# Shovels.ai Marketing Site

This is a static site generated with Pelican. 

## Development

Do the regular initial setup. Create and activate a virtual env and then do:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pelican -lr
```

This will compile the static site into your `output` folder and host a simple HTTP server at that location. The console output will provide you with a link. 

## Production

We currently host on GitHub Pages in the ShovelsAI GitHub organization. GitHub requires the output folder to be `docs` so we have to use a different command.

`pelican content -o docs -s publishconf.py`

However, this doesn't copy over the `output.css` file generated by Tailwind. Manually copy it over to `docs` and then push the `main` branch. That push effectively deploys the updated static site.
