    rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company.  The arbitration proceeding
    will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
    or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
    dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
    authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
    relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s
    rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator
    shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
    findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
    of any damages awarded.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to award
    relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp;
    The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>

    </span></b><b>Waiver of Jury Trial</b>.  YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY
    CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT
    OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Company are instead electing that all disputes, claims,
    or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
    Agreement, except as specified in Section 8.2(a) (Applicability of Arbitration
    Agreement) above.&nbsp; An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
    damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. 
    However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
    arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

    COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
    ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
    OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law
    precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute,
    claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the
    arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State
    of California.  All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be
    arbitrated.</p>
