With Shovels, we address the agency problem in the trades by providing comprehensive data on contractors' permits, inspections, and key metrics across multiple jurisdictions. By crunching the numbers, we offer a unique perspective on contractor skill level and job fit, enabling you to make informed decisions. Our prototype is already live, showcasing the power of Shovels with Contra Costa County data, and we're working towards expanding our coverage to seven Bay Area counties. I'm incredibly grateful for the talented team behind Shovels, including my co-founder and CTO, Luka Kacil.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ryan Buckley sent this newsletter about the launch of Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hello friends, advisors, and (a few) relatives! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of a hiatus, I'm really excited to launch a new company along with an incredible team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process has been a journey. Thanks again to those of you who suffered through my many explanations of half-baked ideas and more than a few false starts. This time is different! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to introduce Shovels, a new way to discover and evaluate building contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an agency problem in the trades. In my economics classes we called it "information asymmetry," a term popularized by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz who proved that this asymmetry leads to inefficient markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you don't need an economics degree to know that hiring a home contractor is fraught with risk. Just talk to anyone who's done it. More often than not, and far more frequently than any other hiring decision I can think of, it's a bad experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is contractors have far more knowledge of their skill level and fit for the job than the people who hire and finance them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels does a few things to address the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We scrape all permits and associate them with contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We include all permit inspections and their results &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do this across multiple jurisdictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we crunch the numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a very compelling new way to look at contractor skill level and job fit. We're calculating new metrics like inspection pass rate and construction speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These metrics are predictive of project outcomes: we know what good and bad contractors look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear over and over again how the entire construction industry is slow to adopt new technology. The field is littered with startups who failed to get contractors to adopt a new app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we're not trying to be in the field. Instead, we're in the offices of the people who decide who to hire and fund and we gather data from the municipalities that issue and inspect building permits. This part of the construction industry is moving online and we're able to take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype is live! It only has Contra Costa County data (about five years worth) but it's enough to see who the major builders are and it shows their key metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out: https://app.shovels.ai/register/. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we're building next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to pull in seven of the nine Bay Area counties this month. That effort will really showcase the power of Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most contractors work in multiple counties and this data isn't centralized anywhere. It takes some heavy technical lifting to grab it all, but we have the expertise to do it. Once this historical data is pulled, we'll continue to update the open permits and grab new permits daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The climate angle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been telling everyone that my next thing will be climate-related. That's still true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, our first paying customer is a climate tech company :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very likely our first several paying customers will be green building contractors, financiers, consultants, and data aggregators. We'll be able to track the proliferation of green buildings and see who's doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on all that is here: https://www.shovels.ai/climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who we are&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least, I want to share a couple of things about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am co-founder and CEO. I just stepped away as CEO of MightySignal after Airnow acquired us last year. We did a ton of data scraping and analysis there and my own (great, fortunately) experience with a major home remodel inspired Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luka Kacil is my co-founder and CTO. He is supremely talented and someone I look forward to being in the trenches with. We met through MightySignal when we acquired his company, AppMonsta, back in 2019. He built and managed the tech stack to scrape all of the Google Play and Apple App stores daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a small team of part-time folks doing hands-on work in data analysis and marketing support.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite facing new challenges that have slowed us down, they have only fueled our determination to create more value. We've had great conversations with potential customers who align perfectly with our ideal profiles. Our back-office operational tasks are well underway, and we've also made strides in fundraising. While we received an offer from a venture studio, we decided to prioritize raising a seed round instead. With my co-founder Luka diligently collecting data and my focus on revenue and fundraising, I'm confident that we're on the right track. Exciting times ahead! Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Dec 2022 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share a few things I've been thinking about recently with this business, but I'll start with an ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to talk to more real estate developers, especially if they're active in Contra Costa County or in the broader SF Bay Area. If you have a friendly one you can intro to me, I'd appreciate it! I want to understand how they vet and hire contractors.
That aside, here's a quick summary and then I'll get into more detail on each item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've improved the way I describe the problem we're solving and our solution for fixing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We encountered some new challenges that are slowing us down -- but also increasing our resolve because hey, the harder it is, the more value we're creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had great conversations with people who match our three ideal customer profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a bunch of progress on boring back office operational stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fundraising progress was had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our problem and how we solve it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is information asymmetry in the labor market for the trades, and this mismatch leads to transactions that make both sides worse off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, that's the problem! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one that homeowners, construction lenders, and real estate developers each have to deal with. The way we solve it is to aggregate building permit and related data and objectively assess the work that these guys do. We use source data to provide the transparency lacking in this market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is unique, and I'll describe why in the next section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New data challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew aggregating this data would be hard. We didn't know it would be this hard. The challenge is several-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no clean public datasets for the detail we want to collect, so we have to find "interesting" ways to grab it.
Once we have it, the data is inconsistent and incomplete. It needs a good amount of TLC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data is distributed among counties and cities, and isn't always online. Sometimes have to make public records requests to get it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that's what makes this work valuable and worth doing. It's also why no one else has already done it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will get easier, too -- I'm hearing directly from city clerks that they're in the process of bringing building permits online. That's encouraging, both for my co-founder Luka, who has to deal with most of this, and for us generally because it means our timing is good. It feels like we're catching the wave for clean, accessible government data, and we can be among the players that bring this critical trend* fully ashore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conversations with potential customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to several "bulls-eye" potential customers. They're exactly the profiles who would want to work with us. Here are a few takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contractor marketplaces (Thumbtack, BuildZoom, etc) seem to refer contractors with whom they have referral agreements. It leads to bad matches and creates distrust on the buy side. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate developers already use public permit databases to see which contractors are active in a region. It's a tedious process that takes several hours to identify a single contractor. The time sink multiplies for every new jurisdiction they have to research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no database available today to look up a property address and get its permit history. 
What does this mean to me? We have work to do! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These potential customers will remain "potential" until we can get more data coverage, which leads me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back office and fundraising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels, Inc. is now officially a Delaware C-corp. We have a bank account, a Stripe account, and real paying customers. I have a CRM flush with conversations to stay on top of. This is a real milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get us even further, we will need to raise a small seed round. I'm talking every day to friends who are making introductions, advisors who critique our pitch deck, and people in the angel and venture investing community who are taking a hard look at Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm hearing so far is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to describe the market size better. Luka and I are working on this, but there's no specific market report for what we do. Our total available market calculation is a bit haphazard. I know it's huge, but I have yet to prove it :) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more customers we get, the easier it will be to fundraise. I'm working on those customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction tech is a tricky area to fundraise. It's not your typical market and many investors shy away. They just don't get it. That's okay -- we're finding others who lean in right away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently received our first offer. We were invited to join a venture studio that would handle a lot of the operations for us, effectively an "in-kind" investment of $500,000+. Ultimately we decided this one was not a great fit, so we're going to focus on raising a seed round instead. It was a good vote of confidence, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. Luka is busy grabbing all the data we can in the SF Bay Area. I'm keeping the revenue and fundraising operation together. It's a grind, but I wouldn't rather be doing anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Our first newsletter is &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/introduction-to-shovels/"&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Why is taking building permits online critical? Let me ascend my climate change soapbox for a moment. Homes need to electrify. It's inevitable that every building will disconnect its gas line in the next 50 years. Getting there requires streamlining the bureaucratic mess that is building permits. We all hate it, so let's make it better. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>February 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/february-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-02-16:/blog/february-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to share the latest updates from Shovels and our journey in the world of building permit data. We've raised a seed round from reputable investors, allowing us to move forward with our plans. Our conversations with property technology and construction financing companies have been fruitful, and we're thrilled to have a roadmap and budget in place for the year ahead. We've also made progress in addressing data challenges, which are common in our field. I'm grateful for the support and advice we've received, and I'm looking forward to sharing more exciting news in our upcoming funding round announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Feb 2023 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to cover, so I'll summarize first and then get into some detail for those who wish to read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We raised a seed round from legit investors and angels, and I plan to gather signatures and checks next week! We'll announce details soon thereafter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've had dozens of great conversations with property technology and construction financing companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a roadmap and budget for the year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We increased our price to $1,000/mo per metro area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also continue to work through data challenges -- to be expected in this corner of the Internet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Heroes" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/heroes.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pic of Luka and me amid a hero's journey through the mystical and enchanted world of building permit databases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took this screenshot, we had recently discovered that there were 45 more permitting jurisdictions than we expected in the SF Bay Area. We'd just committed to a customer that we could scrape all of them. My screen froze during our meeting, and I took this pic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, a friend and fellow entrepreneur texted me to ask how things were going with Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've hit the bogs," I wrote back. "We're plodding through the shit." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's my favorite part!" he replied. Usually, it's mine too, but I was stressed and worried at that moment. What else had I underestimated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did mention this was a hero's journey, right? A hero sets out on a high-risk adventure, encounters adversity, and overcomes it. The arc of entrepreneurship is one long hero's journey, but within that long arc are countless smaller ones. This data challenge is an example of one of those smaller arcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cut to the chase: we set out to grab all permits in the SF Bay Area. We encountered much more work than expected, fretted for a couple of weeks, and then found a solution. Huzzah! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now purchasing raw permit and inspection data from a data vendor. Remarkably, this simple development led to a string of wins over the last couple of months. It's why I skipped the January newsletter -- I wanted to include the next win before sending it, and the wins just kept coming, so I never clicked send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here we are in mid-February, so I'm just going to send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from our fundraise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's never easy, but I have to say, it felt like we had something akin to "investor-market-fit." The firms that passed did so for a few common reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're too early. Not enough revenue or traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're not focused enough on climate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're not familiar enough with proptech / construction tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our best conversations were with firms who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believe in B2B and are willing to invest in new markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciate my background in VC and PE-backed startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like data-as-a-service business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fund that I was excited about turned us down because they were too close to the contractor data market. He spent years working at one of the big contractor marketplaces. When he declined to invest, he gave me the best advice: "You need to find an investor who is as irrationally excited about this idea as you are." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advice stuck with me, and I remained optimistic that I would find some irrationally excited funds and angel investors. And that's what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll announce who they are once we're signed, sealed, and delivered 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from my many customer interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's one piece of startup advice that I hear over and over again, it's this: interview customers from day 1... and never stop. I have taken this to heart. I have customer calls nearly every day. Usually multiple. I have learned A LOT. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like investors, the best meetings come from referrals. I get a call nearly every time someone we both know introduces me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold emailing is getting a lot harder. When it works, it works well, but it's a numbers game, and I have to get lucky. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proptech customers have many uses for clean and processed permit data. Their needs are unique, but our delivery is the same. They all want to store this data internally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many would pay a premium for weekly or daily permit data refreshes rather than monthly updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction banks can use our processed data for underwriting and loan draw decisions, but they need broad coverage to see the value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've given quotes ranging from $500/mo to $10,000/mo. I love that. Our geographic coverage is the only thing keeping me from closing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hiring! We'd appreciate any candidate intros. Feel free to share these job descriptions: &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Intros to construction loan people. I want more interviews. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intros to developers who do 10+ projects at a time in the Bay Area. I need to learn more from this segment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next note will officially announce our funding round, and then probably we'll settle into a quarterly update to all of you friends and/or family and/or investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the special fundraising update email and other updates since last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have raised $610,000 so far, with more likely to come in the next few weeks! (Timing likely will be delayed by the Silicon Valley Bank failure and related malaise.) This money is in the bank, so it's official.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still taking a few very strategic fundraising calls. We don't need more money, but I'm receptive to any investors who could help us find product-market fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of product-market fit, that's top of mind now and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Expect this to be the central topic of these newsletters going forward!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And to that end, I completely rewrote &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. It still needs some color, but I'm happy with the copy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;Green Contractor Directory&lt;/a&gt; prototype!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fundraise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to share that our lead investor is Zach Coelius from &lt;a href="https://coelius.vc/"&gt;Coelius Capital&lt;/a&gt;. He's an ideal lead for us. I've known of Zach for years. We've been in the same circles but didn't really connect until late last year after I attended one of his dinners in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach knows the super early stages as well as anybody. He'll be a great sounding board as we come up against critical decisions and can help us raise funds to accelerate growth if needed. We're delighted to have his support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other angel investors, whom I won't name directly but can describe as old friends, new friends, former bosses, and fans of my personal blog, were the first to sign and send their checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luka and I are humbled and grateful -- and ready to get back to work :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to learn. The permit and contractor data landscape is evolving rapidly, and we are a player in this space. The other companies are aware of us and reacting to our presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I'm good at, perhaps because I enjoy doing it, is getting to know my neighbors. I like to be friendly with my business neighbors, too. I want to know everyone in the market. Not just know their names, but meet them, exchange messages, and (try to) be friends. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it leads to profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses that look like competitors can turn out to be partners, customers, or lead to friendly mergers. This has happened at every company I've run. It happened again recently with Shovels. I'm really happy about this development because it opens up a big opportunity for us in the contractor data market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractor data is what I said we'd do in the early days of Shovels. Late last year, though, I became very excited about permit data. I saw a huge opportunity there. I still see it. I'd reach out or be introduced to potential customers under the pretense of contractor data and discover that what they really wanted was permits. It's a huge opportunity, but I don't think it's ours to get. We don't have enough value to add there; the incumbents will meet this need well and soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractor data is a different story. It's underserved, and we have a tremendous opportunity right now to fill the void. I describe the four segments on &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;: software, climate, finance, and builders. I'll write more detail about all four in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coming Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a very exciting product roadmap! We're going to expand our little &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;green contractor prototype&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to make all of the San Francisco Bay Area available; this demo currently has only 500 records.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to release an API (application programming interface -- a way for computer programmers to easily access this data) and put contractor landing pages up on our website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next quarter, we're going to layer on additional datasets to make the contractor information even more insightful. I'll share more details on these data layers soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we're going deep on contractor data and we're starting in the SF Bay Area. I'll share more next month when more products are released! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>April 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/april-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-04-20:/blog/april-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've raised over $960,000 in our successful fundraising journey, thanks to amazing investor support.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more updates since last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have now raised $960,000, up from $610,000 last month. We're very grateful for the investor support and ready to prove that customers are equally excited about what we're building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more detail on the ICPs (ideal customer profiles) we're targeting. The picture continues to get clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're also excited about AI/GPT/LLMs, etc. I'll share a couple of snippets about how we're using this latest (justifiably) hyped up technology. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new data is coming, and we have plans to go national. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very pleased to add &lt;a href="https://www.coolclimatecollective.com/"&gt;Cool Climate Collective&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venture.angellist.com/zach-coelius/syndicate"&gt;Coelius Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coolclimatecollective.com/"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manaventures.vc/"&gt;Mana Ventures&lt;/a&gt; to our list of investors. We also added another friendly angel. We'll close this seed round at just over $1M, punt any new interest to the next round, and focus 100% on execution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still do customer interviews every day. It's incredibly helpful. Although I'm eager to actually close deals, since it's taken longer to process the data we've acquired than we originally anticipated, I'm able to have more wide-ranging conversations. I'm not held back by what we have in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning that there are all sorts of problems that can be addressed with permit data. We can go very deep into pre-construction timelines, serving information about approval steps, costs, and timing. My focus previously was on construction, what happens once the permit is approved. There's a whole other world of pre-construction data going back to when a permit is submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serving this market will require going deeper into planning departments, requesting data from public utilities, and even scanning planning commission minutes and agendas. We can't do all of this tomorrow, but it feels well within the scope of Shovels to tackle it eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, our latest ICPs look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Construction loan portfolio manager at a bank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: Limited information about contractor quality when asked to underwrite a new loan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Contractor metrics and permits summary delivered as a PDF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Construction loan fund controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No idea what else a contractor is working on when they're asked to approve a loan draw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solutions&lt;/em&gt;: Current and past contractor metrics and permits history delivered as JSON via API, and webhooks for permit processing time changes in a set of jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Large condo developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No visibility into pre-construction permit timelines in a given jurisdiction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Web app interface to look up detailed permit and planning approval timelines in different cities and counties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Proptech CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No programmatic way to see if a house has an active permit already&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Permits delivered on a given address via API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you fall into these buckets. If you want to chat, please get in touch! You know I like a good brainstorm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these ideas firm up further, I'll incorporate them "officially" into our website copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the AI stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit it -- I registered shovels.ai because it was the only decent "shovels" domain available. But I'm sure glad we got it! I had no idea AI was going to blow up like this in the months following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual AI application here is pretty obvious. Permits come with a lot of data and not all of it is structured. The AI models do a fantastic job of quickly (meaning: without any contextual training) identifying what the permit is about (meaning: categorizing it). That's just out of the box. We can train AI models to get better over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are front-end uses too. You could imagine asking a chat-like interface about permits on a property, permits performed by a contractor, or who should remodel your kitchen. A lot of people would be excited about this, and we have a role to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going national&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working out a way for us to expand nationally very quickly. It's a direct result of the ICP discussions I've had recently: geographically-constrained data isn't nearly as valuable as national scope. It's a tricky dance but we're making headway and working towards a deal. I hope to be able to announce it next month! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>May 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/may-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-05-24:/blog/may-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our final fundraising total reached an impressive $1,071,939.39. We are grateful for the interest and support we received during this process. We also expanded our team by hiring a full-time data engineer and two talented summer interns. One of our interns developed a chat AI interface for our Shovels API, which will be incorporated into our upcoming website. Additionally, we have been actively considering building and zoning laws and are excited about the potential opportunities they present. On another note, we are thrilled to announce that national data coverage is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels May 2023 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more updates since April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our final fundraising total is $1,071,939.39. I'm happy to connect with any additional interest but we'll ultimately push it to the next round. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hired a full-time data engineer and two summer interns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our interns made a chat AI interface to the &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to incorporate it into a new website we're building this summer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're thinking a lot about building and zoning laws. Aren't you?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National data coverage is right around the corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a wrap! We set out to to raise $1M, pared it back to $500K, then raised the target to $750K and then back again to $1M. Fundraising is hard. It was hard for us too, but I think we did a few things right and caught a bit of good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share a few learnings here about the fundraising process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was told by a climate tech CEO who recently raised several million dollars that I should expect to pitch 100 VCs. She generously shared her VC list with me. I ended up pitching about 20 before finding a lead investor, and then about 20 more to fill out the round to $1M.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing beats customer interviews. I didn't know this at the time, but I refined my investor pitch each time I spoke to a prospect interested in building permit data. It helped me choose the right language, define the right need, and formulate a solution that makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes sense to customers also makes sense to investors. It makes sense that these pitches should be quite similar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to be unique. Investors don't hear a lot of pitches about building permit data, so Shovels doesn't sound like anything else. I can use that to capture their imaginations, and I've learned from customer interviews about the many uses that permit data can have in the pre- and post-construction phases. I can make Shovels sound big &lt;em&gt;because it's true&lt;/em&gt;. This can be a VERY big business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors and customers love the Shovels brand. We lucked into that bit of inspiration (the first domain I bought for this project was ChooseAGC -- "choose a general contractor" -- not nearly as cool). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we got lucky that our lead investor bought in right away and has stood by us the rest of the fundraising journey.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share a bit of high-level strategy about how we operate Shovels, which also worked well when fundraising. For anyone who knows me and reads my stuff, this strategy below should not be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two central operating principles in our 2023 budget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to breakeven as quickly as possible. This means staying lean for as long as possible and offsetting expenses with related revenue wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert investment into ARR. This ensures a good return for investors as well as founders. It’s &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; equity we’re selling, after all! If we raise $1M, we want to be at a $1M annual revenue run rate when we start fundraising the next round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these principles in mind, our financial projections are modeled with the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total burn of about $500K. We want to spend no more than half of funds raised before reaching breakeven, so we’ll still have powder left for growth experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peak burn of about $70K/mo. High fixed costs are salaries and data acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be at breakeven by summer 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the assumptions built into this model are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can limit churn to 1% per month and upsell at 0.5% per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luka can get by with 1 data engineer to breakeven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan can get by with 2 junior sales or 1 senior sales person to breakeven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ACV is at least $1,000/mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our product works and excites our customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can reach profitability by selling just our API products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to leverage my background with Xenon Partners to execute on revenue while being sensitive to cash flow by utilizing SEO and high impact content on target social media networks for market development. I also expect that our product will be great and we’ll continue to get word-of-mouth referrals because my co-founder is a badass CTO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors liked, if not &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;, this message. The ones that weren't impressed, I wouldn't want to work with anyway. It's an important filter for me so I was very open about it. Plus, it's true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hire two summer interns. Luka got his data engineer (Petra is fantastic!) and I'm still experimenting with some sales strategies before hiring anyone full-time. In sum these are not insignificant expenses, but I can justify them 100% knowing that everyone at Shovels is working towards one goal right now: &lt;strong&gt;get revenue as fast as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More thinking about AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from last month's newsletter, I have a few updates to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This summer we're looking at all the large language model (LLM) options and figuring out the right tech stack to use to process millions of permit records through it for permit classification and entity extraction (appliances, rooms, quantities, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found another niche in municipal building and planning codes. Someone (might as well be us!) needs to load them into a LLM and use the LLM to figure out what the building rules are: setbacks, height limits, density requirements. These rules can completely disrupt the economics of a large project and they're very difficult to find and update. AI to the rescue! I know we're not the only ones with our eyes on this problem. Solving it is a stretch goal for the summer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, I see good data as our competitive advantage in the coming AI wars. Try asking Bard or ChatGPT what permits have been issued in a given zip code. They can't do it, but we can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going national&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We signed a deal today to get national data starting on June 1. We're working overtime to prep the data pipelines for this influx of data and we'll start reaching out to those of you who have been asking for this for months. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Go-to-market strategies for proptech companies</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-06-22:/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels can help you create an effective go-to-market plan that will ensure your message is heard loud and clear.

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the proptech landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proptech, or property technology, is revolutionizing the real estate industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), proptech companies are creating innovative products and services that are transforming how people live and work with an emphasis on property data. In this section, we will discuss what proptech is and its different categories, the impact of proptech on the real estate industry, highlight some of the most successful proptech companies and their strategies, and share examples of how proptech is transforming how people live and work with an emphasis on property data including building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, proptech consists of software solutions developed to improve efficiency in real estate transactions. It can be divided into three categories; product/service innovation – aimed at improving customer experiences; process automation – aimed at streamlining internal processes; and data-driven analytics – focused on gaining insights from a large amount of data to improve operations. These categories are helping to drive efficiency in both residential and commercial markets across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of proptech has been far-reaching in the real estate industry. From streamlining processes for tenants to providing more detailed insights into market trends for buyers - these technological solutions have enabled businesses to make better decisions faster than ever before. Additionally, they have allowed them to provide their customers with a better experience by utilizing tools such as virtual reality tours or digital payment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most successful proptech companies include &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/"&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wework.com/"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.compass.com/"&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.redfin.com/"&gt;Redfin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.opendoor.com/"&gt;OpenDoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.divvyhomes.com/"&gt;Divvy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reonomy.com/"&gt;Reonomy&lt;/a&gt; to name a few. Each company has its own unique strategy for success but all have leveraged technology to create products that make it easier for consumers to access information about properties or facilitate transactions quickly and conveniently online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing convenience for consumers searching for properties or looking to close a transaction quickly, proptech solutions like building permits also benefit businesses by giving them access to up-to-date information about local regulations quickly so they can avoid compliance issues or costly delays during development projects. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.accela.com/"&gt;Accela's&lt;/a&gt; govtech permit module enables users to easily search for permits within their city or county in order to view detailed information about each permit including who applied for it when it was filed and when it was granted or denied. This not only saves time but also helps developers stay informed about local rules while planning new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, proptech offers tremendous potential both for consumers who are looking for more convenient ways of accessing information about properties or closing a transaction quickly, as well as businesses who need access up -to -date information quickly in order stay compliant with local regulations while planning projects. By leveraging these technologies, proptech companies can create effective go-to-market strategies that will help them reach their target audiences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing target audience personas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing target audience personas is an important step for proptech companies to reach their customers. Personas define the characteristics of a customer segment, allowing businesses to create marketing strategies that are tailored to the specific needs and desires of that group. By understanding their target audience, proptech companies can craft effective messaging that resonates with them and helps them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing target audience personas should be done during the planning phase of any go-to-market strategy as it will inform all subsequent decisions about how best to reach those customers. It’s also important for a proptech company to analyze customer behavior in order to determine what types of messaging they respond most positively towards. For example, understanding which channels they use most frequently and what types of content they consume can help inform which methods would be most effective for reaching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permits are another key tool for understanding when a persona is in the market for a proptech purchase. Building permits offer insight into when people are ready or likely to invest in property technology products or services such as automated home energy monitors, smart security systems, or heat pump HVAC systems. By leveraging this data, businesses can customize their go-to-market plan accordingly and ensure that their message reaches potential customers at the right time with maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking these steps, proptech companies can create effective marketing strategies tailored towards their desired audiences that will help them maximize success and reach their goals. Developing comprehensive target audience personas is key for any business looking to make an impact with its go-to-market strategy, and especially so for those operating within the ever-evolving proptech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a go-to-market plan using building permits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a go-to-market plan using building permits is an important step for just about every proptech company. Building permits are documents that allow businesses to carry out construction or renovation projects, and they provide valuable information on who the target market is for a particular proptech product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of building permits: residential and commercial. Residential building permits refer to those issued for homes, such as single-family residences or duplexes, while commercial building permits refer to those issued for large-scale projects, such as multi-family dwellings or retail stores. Understanding these permit types can help proptech companies determine which types of customers will benefit most from their products or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a proptech company is offering a smart home energy management system, they might look for recently approved residential building permits in order to identify potential buyers who would be interested in the product. On the other hand, if the proptech company offers a cloud-based property management system suitable for large buildings with multiple tenants, then they may look at recently approved commercial building permits in order to find potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's a tool available that makes it easier to quickly find homeowners and contractors who have recently submitted or completed a building permit: Shovels. With Shovels, proptech companies can use advanced search tools and filters to narrow down potential customers based on criteria such as location and type of project (residential vs. commercial). This allows them to create targeted marketing strategies tailored specifically towards their target audiences more efficiently than traditional methods like cold calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the right technologies like Shovels and understanding how building permits work as part of their go-to-market strategy, proptech companies can reach their target customers more effectively and maximize their success in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the right technologies for your proptech company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right technologies for your proptech company is essential for reaching out to your target audiences and maximizing success. The technologies you choose should be tailored to the needs of your business, so it’s important to take the time to research what’s available and understand how they can work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to reach out to potential customers is through direct mail. &lt;a href="https://www.lob.com/"&gt;Lob&lt;/a&gt; is a valuable tool for proptech companies, as it allows them to send out direct mail pieces with a home address on them. This helps build trust between potential customers and your brand, as it shows that you’re willing to put in the extra effort when communicating with them, especially when using building permits to reach out at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of reaching out via phone or email is by using a homeowner phone and email database. These databases allow you to access contact information for potential customers, allowing you to connect directly with personalized messages that speak to their specific projects. You can also use these databases to track customer behavior over time, giving you a better understanding of who your target audience is and how best to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, hiring a software consultant or using your engineering team can help stitch APIs together and automate processes such as data collection and analysis. This means that all the data collected from different sources will be automatically compiled into one place, allowing you to make more informed decisions about which technologies are best suited for your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selecting the right technologies for your proptech company, you can create an effective go-to-market strategy that will help you reach your target audiences and maximize success in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success is essential for proptech companies that want to maximize their return on investment. Proptech companies can use a variety of strategies to measure and optimize their success, such as regularly analyzing data, conducting A/B tests, and taking customer feedback into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing data regularly is one of the most important strategies for measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success. By looking at data trends over time, proptech companies can better understand how their marketing efforts are performing in terms of website visits, conversions, customer satisfaction scores, etc., as well as identify any potential issues or anomalies. This allows them to make informed decisions about how to tweak campaigns or products in order to maximize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A/B testing is another powerful tool that proptech companies can use to measure the effectiveness of changes they have made to their marketing efforts. A/B testing involves creating two versions of a piece of content (e.g., an email) and then testing both versions on different audiences in order to determine which one performs better. This technique enables proptech companies to experiment with different approaches without having to guess what will work best for their target customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, taking customer feedback into account is essential when it comes to measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success. By asking customers questions about their experience with your product or service after they’ve used it, you can gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn’t work from a user’s perspective – information which you can then use to improve campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, using surveys or focus groups provides another way for proptech companies to gain insights into what would improve the customer experience and increase engagement rates with their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the right technologies and following these strategies for measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success, proptech companies can ensure that they reach the right audiences with the right message at the right time - helping them maximize their return on investment in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="GTM"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category></entry><entry><title>June 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/june-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-06-28:/blog/june-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Enough with the fundraising blah blah blah.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the fundraising blah blah blah. It's time to start talking about building permits! Here's the quick newsletter summary: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are cranking through 100 million building permits and doing all the things: cleaning, normalizing, fixing, and scrubbing so you can &lt;em&gt;get great data.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order of release will be California, Florida, Texas, and New York. I'll announce the next tranche in a month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some really interesting go-to-market (GTM) uses for building permits. I'll name a few. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-bird pricing will be available in the next newsletter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are burning up the servers at AWS! Amazon has granted multiple requests to increase our &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/"&gt;Fargate&lt;/a&gt; limits. That's how cool we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing all of this data is not without its challenges. While I hoped we'd have all of California launched already, we're doggone close, and I know you're going to love what we deliver. Here are a few of the things you can look forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permits in over 200 jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;. The Golden State LOVES local permitting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building electrification tagging&lt;/strong&gt;. We've identified all the permits related to batteries, heat pumps, EV chargers, and solar panels. We 💚 the 🌎 too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor rollups&lt;/strong&gt;. All these permits and tags roll up to contractors so you can see who's doing how much of what type of work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalized addresses&lt;/strong&gt;. The lovely people who enter permits into databases do all sorts of funny things with addresses, making us 🥺. So we fixed them for you.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, we are so close to launch. Soo close! We'll send a quick newsletter out when it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to do with permits: GTM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people come through our marketing funnel, I always ask them what they plan to do with Shovels data. The uses are varied, but there's been an increasingly common use case: go-to-market (GTM). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense! Building permits are a gold mine for both B2B and B2C buyer intent. For B2B, a submitted commercial building permit means that the builder is in purchasing mode. Construction tech companies should get on it! Building entry systems, HVAC components, project management software... the roof's the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For B2C, a recently completed residential permit is a prime target for property tech companies. That homeowner is now ready to fix the lawn that just got torn up, install a new driveway, or put up solar panels. We can filter for EV chargers and batteries so climate tech companies can reach out about cost-cutting software add-ons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more detail about all of this in our latest blog post: &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/"&gt;Go-to-market strategies for proptech companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still figuring it out, but I'm certain that we will offer a low-volume plan and special unlimited volume pricing for CA, FL, TX and NY once it's loaded. In the future, we'll offer pricing tiers for historical data and enhanced permit details. For our earliest customers, though, we'll throw it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll let you know when you can get in on this Shovels API pricing bonanza. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Go-to-market strategies for contech companies</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-contech-companies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-07-10:/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-contech-companies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grow your contech startup with this comprehensive guide to go-to-market strategies, covering topics such as identifying target markets, developing an effective plan, and leveraging building permits to identify potential customers.

&lt;h2&gt;Overview of contech and go-to-market strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go-to-market strategies are essential for construction technology (contech) companies to succeed in the competitive market. To reach their goals and grow their business, contech companies must have an effective go-to-market strategy that is tailored to the needs of their target customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and executing an effective go-to-market strategy can be challenging. It requires careful planning, market research, and dedication. To ensure success, contech companies need to identify target markets, develop a plan of action with specific goals and objectives, leverage building permits to identify potential customers, create a marketing plan for reaching those customers, track performance metrics, and finally measure customer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful go-to-market plan for contech companies should include several key components. First, it should clearly define the target audience and outline the customer journey from awareness through purchase. Additionally, it should include an analysis of competitive offerings in the same space as well as strategies for achieving a competitive advantage in the market. Finally, it should demonstrate how the company will monitor its progress towards its goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you are a contech startup with a few million dollars in VC funding. The rest of this blog post is about how you can create your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying your target market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying your target market is an integral part of any successful go-to-market plan. Knowing who you are targeting, and understanding their needs, preferences, and behaviors allows you to craft a marketing message that will resonate with them and drive conversions. Here are some key steps that you should take when identifying your target market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define and segment the target market: Start by defining the primary demographic characteristics for your ideal customer base – age, gender, income level, education level, etc. Then segment this broader group into distinct subgroups based on psychographic characteristics such as lifestyle and interests as well as geographic criteria like location or climate. This is basic Marketing 101 stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research the needs of the target market: Once you have identified your target market segments, it's time to conduct research to understand what drives them. This could include surveying customers about their preferences or using data from online search behavior to identify what topics they are interested in learning more about. This research will help you define your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map out the customer journey: By understanding how customers interact with products or services throughout their journey (awareness stage through purchase), you can identify areas where they may be experiencing pain points that need solutions. Analyzing competitor activity can also provide insights into potential customer behavior so you can better customize your go-to-market strategies accordingly. Knowing if your target customers already use a competing product and what they think about that product can yield powerful insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use primary and secondary research methods: Primary research involves gathering information directly from customers through surveys or interviews while secondary research involves collecting existing data from sources such as industry reports or government statistics databases. Both types of research are important when it comes to developing an accurate picture of the target market so you can effectively tailor your go-to-market approach for maximum success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking these steps to identify and understand their target market, you can create a successful go-to-market plan tailored to meet your unique goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing an effective go-to-market plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some key steps to help you create a successful go-to-market plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Align the strategy with your company's mission and objectives: Your strategy should clearly define what you are trying to achieve and how you will accomplish your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a timeline for implementation: A timeline helps make sure that tasks are completed on time, resources are allocated efficiently, and goals are met on schedule. Timelines also keep you organized in case something unexpected arises or needs adjustment along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline necessary resources: Developing an effective go-to-market plan requires having access to the right resources. These may include personnel, marketing materials, customer service support teams, technical assistance, and budget for data acquisition, depending upon your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track progress &amp;amp; adjust as necessary: As you implement your go-to-market strategy, it's important to track progress against set objectives throughout the process so that you can make any needed adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leveraging building permits to identify players in your target market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging building permits to identify players in your target market can be a very powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permit data is an invaluable resource for understanding the competitive landscape and identifying potential customers that may need contech services or products. By using this data, you can gain valuable insights into your target market and use that information to better inform your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of building permits that can provide you with useful insight into your target market. Residential building permits give you a better understanding of the homeowners who might need your services, while commercial building permits provide information about businesses in the area that may benefit from your products. Additionally, local and state ordinances can give you insight into zoning regulations and other rules that could affect the success of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To leverage building permits for market research purposes, first look up what types of permits are available in your area, then search for those specific permit types in Shovels to get additional details about any applicable property or project. Shovels will produce lists of addresses and the contractors working on those projects. Both the building owner and the contractor can be prospective customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also track changes in permit activity over time to see if there has been any recent growth or decline in your target geographical markets. By tracking these changes, you can adjust your strategies accordingly and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging building permit data to identify players in your target market, you can gain valuable insight into the competitive landscape and develop an effective go-to-market strategy tailored specifically to your own unique circumstances. Building permits are the ultimate buyer signal for contech go-to-market planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="GTM"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category></entry><entry><title>The growth of EV chargers in California</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-07-24:/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Shovels, we provide developers with access to monthly EV charger installation data through our building permit API. This data reveals the tremendous growth and geographic distribution of EV charging infrastructure, with insights into the locations and companies involved. Understanding this data is crucial for businesses, developers, and governments to identify areas for expansion and to make informed decisions. With our API, developers can accurately map existing charger locations, analyze infrastructure, and even predict future demand for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the world embraces green energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular. This surge in EV adoption has driven a rapid expansion of the EV charging infrastructure – and now developers can use our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;building permit API&lt;/a&gt; to access monthly EV charger installation data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our EV charger permit data shows tremendous growth of EV charging infrastructure. We see where it's happening and who's doing the installations. To learn more about how to access this valuable data, check out our API documentation at https://shovels.redoc.ly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview of EV charging infrastructure expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California's EV charging infrastructure is experiencing unprecedented growth as demand for electric vehicles continues to grow. Government policies, such as subsidies and tax incentives, which have created a favorable environment for the growth of the EV market have driven this surge in EV adoption. In addition, technology advancements have lowered the cost of EV charging systems, allowing consumers to easily charge electric vehicles at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, many cities have introduced curbside chargers that allow users to charge their cars while they are parked on the street or in parking garages. New public chargers are added daily across the country. Businesses and organizations are also making significant investments in EV infrastructure. Private companies are building large-scale networks of high-powered chargers that can charge multiple cars at once. These networks can be found in airports, shopping centers, and other areas with high traffic. Additionally, many municipalities are investing heavily in public charger networks, making it easier than ever before to find a charger when you need one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These advancements in technology and policy initiatives have helped create an incredibly robust and rapidly growing EV charging infrastructure that is helping drive consumer adoption of EVs worldwide. Developers are now able to access detailed EV charger installation data through the Shovels API. We share historical trends and the exact places and companies who carried out the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gathering and analyzing EV charger data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering and analyzing EV charger data is essential for businesses, developers, and governments to understand the current state of the EV charging market and identify areas where it needs to be expanded. With the right tools, developers can accurately map out existing EV charger locations and explore geographic distribution of charger networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic information systems (GIS) are powerful tools that enable developers to map out EV charger locations based on their lat/long coordinates or addresses. GIS can also be used to analyze existing infrastructure to identify areas with high demand for additional charging stations. Companies can use Shovels data to see residential EV charger activity, which could inform the location for commercial charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For utilities, this data will be helpful to perform stress test modeling on the electrical grid. For states that have put in place GHG reduction goals, understanding consumer adoption of EV chargers will provide more support for transitioning power sources to solar, wind, and other renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EV Charger chart" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/shovels_ev_prediction.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insights from our EV charger permit dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining the EV charger data contained in our building permit API, we can gain a new level of insight into the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rbucks/monthly-ev-charger-permits"&gt;public link to this dataset on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the number of EV charger permits in California from 2012 to 2022 is approximately 38.76%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on monthly EV data going back to 2012, we predict California will see about 11,000 EV permits in 2023, roughly 40% more than 2022, and 13,000 EV permits in 2024, another 20% jump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears that the months of August, October, and September have the highest average number of permits. Here are those monthly averages between 2012 and 2022:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: 184.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February: 150.91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: 186.91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: 192.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: 201.73&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: 211.18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: 203.18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: 239.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: 236.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: 240.55&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: 214.45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: 229.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that the number of permits also seems to be lower in the beginning of the year and tends to increase as the year progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of permits issued each month varies significantly, indicating the presence of considerable volatility in the data. This could be due to various factors such as changes in governmental policies, market demand, technological advancements, and other external factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one slice of our permit data. We also offer a comprehensive overview of current and future trends in all energy transition activities, including heat pumps and solar installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to access building permit data with Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing building permit data is essential for developers, businesses, government, and researchers who want to understand the current state of energy transition infrastructure and identify areas where it needs expansion. To make this process easier, we have a building permit API that enables our customers to query building permits by the type of work involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can query for wall battery permits, heat pump HVAC conversions, solar panel installations, and EV charger networks. The data returned from these queries can be used for construction go-to-market activities, providing highly targeted leads for sales teams. Developers can also use this data to create applications related to energy transition activities, such as mapping out EV charger locations or predicting future demand for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, we are actively following up with Florida, Texas, and New York, and we remain on track to expand nationwide by the end of summer. We have also created a dashboard showcasing building electrification permits in Contra Costa County and made predictions for EV charging permits in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing from Sunriver, OR, where my family's vacation ground to a halt due to air quality. There's a wildfire in Oregon. Several, actually, but the one that's bothering me right now is smoldering 75 miles to the west, and it smells like the inside of a chimney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In happier news: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally broke through a bunch of data processing hurdles to load up all of California into our internal database. The API update is imminent! We now show 21M building permits in California, where the air is perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still following up with Florida, Texas, and New York. We'll know more about going nationwide after this, but I'm confident that we'll get there by the end of summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our really smart friend made a cool dashboard of building electrification permits in Contra Costa County. We also tried to predict the number of EV charging permits in 2024. Links to both are below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-bird pricing is here. How does $1K/mo for unlimited access through 2023 sound?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Processing update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full API data load is just days away. We want this next release to be pretty much perfect! With that in mind, we made these improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleared out all the "nan" and "null" values in the API results &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified our tag list and made sure that each one has permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further improved our address matching (this one was tricky!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sped up the overall processing time by using more efficient data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few cool statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Californians file about 100,000 building permits each month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA and Orange Counties make up a third of all historical CA building permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA, San Diego, Riverside, and Orange Counties have a third of all &lt;em&gt;solar&lt;/em&gt; permits 🌞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA and Sacramento Counties (finally, some NorCal representation) are the leaders in EV charging ⚡️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, LA County filed the most ADU permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in 2022, Riverside County led in new homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder: you can get all of this detail (the individual addresses and contractors) using our API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Charts and dashboards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be surprising that there's a lot of interest in building permits for home electrification. We're seeing this interest from climate tech companies, financial institutions, and even the public sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking the progress of residential EV chargers is important for transportation authorities who need to plan for public EV charging stations. Communities that have more residential chargers will have less demand for public ones, so those resources can go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahidaniels/"&gt;Sarah Daniels&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.daniels4671/viz/CCCTestdashv1/Dashboard1#1"&gt;this amazing dashboard&lt;/a&gt; of building electrification permits in Contra Costa County using Shovels data. If you see a need for something like this in your own community, please let us know! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also put on our data science hats and built a prediction model for EV charger permits in CA through 2024. Predictions are the dotted line. We even decided to write a &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;blog post about it&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

Our analysis reveals significant variations in approval times across different jurisdictions in the state. While some jurisdictions in Northern California have remarkably fast approval times, many Southern California jurisdictions experience delays of up to two months. Streamlining the permitting process could be a key factor in improving EV charger installation rates. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the volume of permits processed and approval times, suggesting that bureaucratic overload is not the primary cause of delays. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and homeowners looking to navigate the complex landscape of EV charger installations and contribute to the transition to cleaner, more sustainable transportation options.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Background on EV charging in California&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our thinking about EV chargers, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;read more about here&lt;/a&gt;, we're turning our attention now to how long it takes for jurisdictions to approve EV charger permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's take a step back. This analysis is important because California has committed to deploying five million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and building out 250,000 charging stations by 2025. This includes building a network of nearly 20,000 Level 2 and DC fast EV charging stations across the state. Additionally, the state plans to invest $2.5 billion over the next five years to expand the EV charging infrastructure and provide incentives for drivers to purchase electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having more residential EV chargers would make it easier for California residents to own and use electric vehicles. This would also relieve the burden on public EV chargers. The more EV chargers we have in homes, the less strain on the public chargers required for people who live in multifamily housing and don't have a dedicated charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More residential EV chargers also creates more jobs and boost the economy. Installation and maintenance of these chargers increases demand for electricians, supporting many local businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential for building permit reform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to get more EV chargers installed is to streamline the permitting process. EV chargers, because they are high-voltage, require a licensed electrician and a building permit to begin the installation, and an inspector must approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this process can be cumbersome, building permits exist to ensure that construction projects adhere to local safety and building codes. This is important for protecting the public and ensuring that buildings are safe and structurally sound. Building permits also provide a way for local governments to track construction projects and collect fees to help fund public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people advocate permitting reform because the current permitting process is overly burdensome, time consuming, and costly, leading to delays and inefficiencies. Permitting reform may reduce the time and cost of obtaining permits, and make it easier for businesses and homeowners to quickly obtain the necessary approvals to install appliances like EV chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, with that background, let's look at the data in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels analysis of EV charger permit approval times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels collects and analyzes building permit data. Two data points that we consistently see are the file date, or when the permit was submitted to the jurisdiction, and the issue date, or when the jurisdiction approved the permit. At this point, work can begin, and we'll eventually see the final date, or when the work was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file date and the issue date show how long it takes for a jurisdiction to process a permit. As anyone who has had work done knows, this can be an agonizing process. The longer the delay, the more likely your contractor will get busy or supply costs will increase. Homeowners and contractors both want faster permit approval times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we set out to ask a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differences between jurisdictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurisdiction comparison: Which jurisdictions have the fastest and slowest average EV permit approval times? How do they compare to each other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there differences in permit approval times between Northern and Southern California?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the jurisdictions with the SLOWEST EV median charger permit approval times. We go with the median because there are outliers in the data that will skew the mean. You can see this in the table below, which shows that the mean is greater than the median in each case. The standard deviation and IQR (interquartile range) also demonstrate the skew. Therefore, the median is our best way to compare jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that four of the five slowest permitting jurisdictions are in Southern California. The median approval times are at least two months. That's too long! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worst EV charger permit times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/top5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking now at the FASTEST EV charger timing jurisdictions, we see median times of less than a week. Interstingly, all but one of the jurisdictions is in Northern California. Even the averages here are reasonable, coming in at less than a month in the top four, but jumping to nearly three months average in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;San Diego County&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;89.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;89.07&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;119.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;118.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Best EV charger permit times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/bottom5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, we see the apparent impact of outliers. San Diego has a media approval time of five days, but an average of three months. A few crazy long wait times down there are pulling the average away from the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Histogram of San Diego EV charger permit approval times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/sd-histogram.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because it was interesting, to further investigate this distinction between Northern California and Southern California, we made one more chart. It tells the story that emerged just by looking at the top 5 and bottom 5 jurisdictions: Northern California issues EV charger permits faster than Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern CA vs Southern CA" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/norcal-v-socal.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatness of the bottom of the candlestick shows the bottom and top quartile wait times. A smaller candle is better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trends over time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How has the average EV permit approval time changed over the years for each jurisdiction? Are there any jurisdictions where the approval time is consistently getting faster or slower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there certain times of the year when EV permit approval times are generally faster or slower? This could indicate seasonal workload fluctuations in permit offices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we looked for jurisdictions where permit approval times are getting worse and others where they are getting better. Bucking the NorCal/SoCal trend described above, we found that permit times are getting better in Riverside County and worse in Milpitas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Riverside County approval times by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/riverside-county.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Milpitas approval times by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/milpitas.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permit counts by year for each county might give some clues as to what's going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Riverside County and Milpitas EV charger permit counts by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/riverside-milpitas-count.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the looks of these three charts, we find that the number of EV charger permits in Riverside County skyrocketed during the pandemic, and the jurisdiction must have put some permit streamlining reforms in place because despite the higher volume, they kept the processing times down. This combination led to a precipitous drop in permit approval times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the COVID question was interesting, so we looked across the board and came up with this chart. The processing times actually improved after COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Impact of COVID on permit approval times in California" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/covid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The relationship between permit volume and approval times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there a correlation between the number of permits a jurisdiction processes and the speed of approval? In other words, do jurisdictions that process more EV permits tend to approve them faster or slower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result surprised us. We assume that bureaucratic government departments are easily overwhelmed. As the number of permit applications increases, we expect that approval times would get slower. In fact, there's no relationship between the volume of permits and the processing times across the jurisdictions in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scatter of approval times and volumes" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/approval-times-scatter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pearson correlation coefficient here is −0.0730. This value indicates a very weak negative relationship. In other words, there's actually a slight tendency for jurisdictions that process more EV permits to approve them a bit faster, but the relationship is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! That was a lot of information about EV charger approval times. It seems we're still just scratching the surface. If you want to do more analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/contact"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We have lots of data. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category><category term="ev chargers"></category><category term="permit timeline"></category></entry><entry><title>August 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/august-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-08-17:/blog/august-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels, the leading provider of building permit and contractor API services, is expanding to Florida and Texas, with plans to cover all 47 remaining states by end of summer. We recently added date filters to our API, allowing users to easily access the most relevant data. Our team has also resolved any issues related to displaying dates in the API response. We are developing a new website that will offer registration and API key services, as well as a data explorer portal. Looking ahead, we are working on new market endpoints for building permits, providing valuable insights into current and historical trends by zip code.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like California. I've lived here my whole life, and so have both of my parents and most of my grandparents. That's why when we launched Shovels, we started in California. Why wouldn't we? California is the best 😎.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we keep hearing that the home of the Grateful Dead and Clint Eastwood is just not enough. You want more, so by golly, you'll get more. We are launching Florida and Texas in just a few days. And soon after that... the remaining 47 🇺🇸!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what else is going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We added date filters to the API and fixed some issues displaying dates in the API response 🎉&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're building out a brand new website on some brand new technology. It will allow us to quickly add registration and API key services, as well as a data explorer portal for you folks that prefer not to deal with API endpoints. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That $249/mo price is live. On this plan you get 1,000 lookups per month in any  one state (so long as it's California... for now :) A self-serve pricing page will go up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API update: Date filters!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dates are important! You might not care about the roofing permit from 10 years ago, but you definitely care about the one filed last week. Our new date filters allow you to hone in on precisely the data you care most about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also now default sort permits by date descending, so in all responses, when you see a list of permits, the most recent ones are first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is live already (as of about 12 hours ago!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, we added two new demos: &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/9ab4b347-6227-4ee3-8648-b1e0dc632e1b"&gt;Permit Directory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;Contractor Directory&lt;/a&gt;. You have to add a zip code and both the start and end dates for the demos to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to test it out, you'll need an API key. Just reply and I'll get one for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sneak preview: &lt;strong&gt;markets&lt;/strong&gt;. We're starting to plan for a new set of markets endpoints that will tell you all sorts of interesting current and historical trends for building permits by zip code. This data will be fantastic for those who are trying to prioritize sales territories by identifying where certain types of building activity is happening.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Calculate approval times&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most of our permits we are able to see the file date and the issue date, which bookend the jurisdiction's permit processing period. In other words, we can see which jurisdictions are slow and which ones are quick to approve permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For building developers, this is really important information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we keep hearing from EV charger companies, we decided to continue on our investigation of this industry with a post on EV charger permit approval times in California. We looked at every EV charger permit over the last few years and tallied them up by jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one insight: &lt;strong&gt;We learned that Oakland approves EV charger permits 30X faster than LA&lt;/strong&gt;. Crazy, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

We also updated our monthly API pricing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Las Vegas. I'm on Day 5 and very happy to be heading home now. 😮‍💨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel proud today. The Shovels team, all three of us, had a very productive two weeks working together in-person. I'm going to share some highlights below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 We processed 100M building permits! We can run custom SQL queries and export CSV files for residential and commercial buildings nationwide. 🚀&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States currently available in the API: California, Texas, Florida, and New York. Now that the rest are processed, we'll begin loading them into the API too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of API, we released our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Markets/operation/get_market_activity_by_zip_code_v1_markets_permits_zip_get"&gt;markets endpoint&lt;/a&gt;. We count current and historical building permit counts on all of our zip codes sliced by any of our tags. I'll describe an interesting application for this data below! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also released &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;new prettier API docs&lt;/a&gt;. Why does this matter? I'll tell you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our pricing matrix is good to go. You'll know what cost to expect when you're ready to get on this building permit data bandwagon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;100 million building permits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know most people reading this newsletter aren't data nerds. I'm glad for that. I'm also glad that I'm surrounded by people who love thinking about and wrangling with data. Building permit data is particularly challenging because it uses data types that are prone to be inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, look at these addresses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate Drive, Las Vegas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate, Las Vegas, NV 89133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate DR, 89133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know these are all the same address. But you're human and you're an expert at deduction. How do you get machines, which aren't built for ambiguity, to know these addresses are the same? And then how do you get machines to fill in the missing address components? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many, many fascinating (dare I say fun?) problems we solved on the road to 100 million permits. I'm so proud of this team for getting through it so quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now we can do stuff like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SQL Screenshot" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/sql.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's a screenshot of SQL. Yes, this is a marketing newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to make a point about what it means to "process" 100 million permits. It means we have them all in a standard taxonomy that allows us to look up the same info across states, counties, and cities and run complex filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm showing here is a way to identify leads for solar installers. This query scans all 100 million building permits in about 3 seconds using inexpensive AWS technology. It's amazing what our team built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it can be yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Learn about neighborhoods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend you're in the market for a new home (or if you really are in this market, don't pretend, and I'm sorry). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are interested in two homes in the same city. They're comparable in size, age, amenities, school district, and price. You'd be happy with either one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a critical difference lurking below surface. They're in different neighborhoods, and different neighborhoods act... differently. We can measure this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say one home is in a neighborhood with very little permit activity. The neighbors aren't maintaining, improving, or expanding their homes. They're not invested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other home is in a neighborhood bustling with solar installs, new ADUs, and kitchen remodels. The homeowners are doubling down on their purchases, in it for the long haul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which house would you prefer now? I know my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new way of looking at neighborhoods. I don't believe this data exists anywhere else. We want to help you get it out there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Neighborhood improvement index" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/neighborhood-index.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a heat map at the zip code level in my neck of the woods (we could also do this block-by-block) showing relative investment in ADUs, kitchens, and other additions. The SQL query that drives it is pretty cool too, but I'll just leave you with the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Beautiful API documentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first company I co-founded was &lt;a href="https://www.scripted.com/"&gt;Scripted&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a business guy, but I've always been fascinated by programming. I guess that's why I landed in tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on at Scripted, I found reasons to get my hands dirty in Ruby and Python. I committed code, reviewed pull requests, and sprinkled bits of "Ryansoft" like fairy dust throughout our repository. I also worked with a lot of APIs, and I got to see the impact first-hand of thoughtful design and helpful documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire companies like Stripe and Clearbit who make it easy for developers to use their products. I want Shovels to be the same. Fortunately, the competition in our market is pretty weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we are going to make Shovels the most developer-friendly construction data API in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;new API docs&lt;/a&gt; are searchable, have input and output samples, and a new page structure. Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Money talk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, yes, we are going to charge money for all this awesomeness. Here's how it looks. &lt;/p&gt;

We take a look at two no-code solutions, Bubble and FlutterFlow, which we used to develop our minimal viable products for Aikito and Shovels.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-Tea-on-Bubble-e29s4k0/a-aadirrd" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development has witnessed a remarkable transformation, thanks in large part to the advent of no-code platforms. These platforms have eased the process of app development, making it accessible to a broader range of founders and startups, with all levels of coding expertise. In this, our first episode of the &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/"&gt;What We Learned This Week In Proptech&lt;/a&gt; we explore this shift, leveraging insights from a recent discussion which sheds light on the practical applications of no-code solutions in various business scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Inevitable Pivot to No-Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, many tech professionals, including myself, viewed no-code platforms with a certain level of skepticism. It's not uncommon for seasoned engineers to dismiss these solutions as inferior or limited​​. However, this perception is rapidly changing as the benefits and potentials of no-code solutions become more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-code platforms offer a way to build applications without writing a single line of code. This is 
particularly valuable for small teams or solo entrepreneurs who need to deploy functional apps quickly without the resources to hire a full-time developer​​. For instance, when faced with the daunting task of creating a web application for loan origination, underwriting, and servicing, especially under the pressure of limited resources and a tight deadline, no-code solutions like Bubble become not just an option but a necessity​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mechanics of No-Code Platforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle behind no-code platforms is fairly straightforward: they provide an interface with drag-and-drop components that can be connected to various data stores. This approach simplifies the development process to the point where hosting is also taken care of by the platform itself​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a setup was instrumental when my co-host, Fernando, needed to pivot his business model due to significant changes in the commercial lending environment. With most resources laid off and a pressing need to adapt quickly, no-code platforms enabled rapid development and deployment​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right No-Code Platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I dove into Reddit forums and other communities to gauge the most popular no-code platforms, &lt;a href="https://bubble.io/"&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly came up as a frontrunner due to its strong footprint and search engine optimization (SEO) presence​​. Its capabilities extend to creating a blend of a marketplace and a project management tool, exemplified by a modified Upwork and Asana template​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, each no-code platform has its limitations and unique features. For example, Bubble uses its proprietary framework, which means you cannot export your code out of the platform. In contrast, platforms like &lt;a href="https://flutterflow.io/"&gt;Flutterflow&lt;/a&gt; offer the flexibility to export the code written in the Flutter language framework and continue development outside the confines of the original no-code environment​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No-Code Cost Efficiency and Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of employing no-code solutions is significantly less than hiring a developer, though it comes with a trade-off in customization. The analogy that resonates here is the difference between buying a prefabricated home and building a custom one from scratch​​. For startups and small businesses, especially in the property technology sector, the ability to quickly test and iterate on an idea without a large upfront investment is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reality of Tech Debt and No-Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of using no-code platforms is the understanding of technical debt. While no-code solutions allow for rapid deployment, they are not immune to the buildup of tech debt. Eventually, there's a need to review and refactor the functionalities built within the no-code environment to ensure scalability and efficiency​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even with no-code solutions, a certain level of technical acumen is necessary. While platforms like Bubble and Flutterflow are user-friendly, they are still complex web applications that require some understanding of technology and design principles to use effectively​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict on No-Code Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-code platforms are changing the landscape of app development and business operations. They empower non-technical founders and teams to bring their ideas to life, providing an avenue for innovation and entrepreneurship that was previously gated by technical barriers. The key to leveraging no-code solutions lies in understanding their strengths and limitations and using them as a stepping stone towards more sophisticated and customized solutions as the business grows and evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to witness the rise of these platforms, it's clear that they are not just a temporary workaround but a fundamental shift in how we approach problem-solving and development in the digital age. No-code is not just about building applications; it's about building opportunities and possibilities for a future where technology is inclusive and accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in to our next episode when we'll discuss fundraising in proptech.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="no-code"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 2: Fundraising in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-2-fundraising-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-01:/blog/episode-2-fundraising-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the second episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando Pizarro and I explore the complexities of fundraising in the proptech sector. We discuss the convergence of proptech and climate tech, highlighting how their ventures integrate sustainable practices into real estate technology. The episode concludes with insights into the evolving Proptech landscape, stressing the significance of strategic partnerships and a strong commitment to business goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Fundraising-Fun-e2a6vr6/a-aaekent" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," my co-host Fernando Pizarro and I, Ryan Buckley, delved into the intricate world of fundraising in Proptech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Art of Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation began with a reflection on fundraising trends. As Fernando pointed out, the financial markets for Proptech are in a state of flux, echoing my observations at Blueprint Las Vegas, where venture capitalists (VCs) exhibited a growing enthusiasm for the sector. This surge in interest is a positive indicator for startups seeking funding, even as the broader VC landscape faces challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared his experiences working at companies like Disney, National Geographic, and Yahoo, and his transition to startups in the Bay Area. His journey in gamification and Go-To-Market strategies, particularly in PropTech, offered a rich perspective on how funding dynamics have evolved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed my own journey with Shovels, the company I co-founded. Our fundraising approach was shaped by lessons from my previous ventures and a determination to avoid the pitfalls I encountered earlier. I emphasized the importance of finding investors who share your vision and passion, echoing advice I received: seek investors who are "irrationally excited" about your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Climate Tech Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant aspect of our discussion revolved around the intersection of proptech and climate tech. We explored how technology in real estate inevitably ties into broader environmental concerns. Fernando’s work in facilitating business owners with sustainable space development showcases this intersection too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Shovels, the connection to climate tech is direct. We leveraged building permits to identify competent contractors, particularly those skilled in installing eco-friendly systems like heat pumps. This approach didn't just align with our business goals but also resonated with many investors' commitment to environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diverse Approaches to Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fundraising strategies, while guided by similar principles, took different paths. Fernando’s approach was deeply influenced by his rich network and personal connections. My journey with Shovels was a mix of leveraging networks and targeting investors aligned with our mission and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us agreed that while the process is challenging, the right investor relationship can be a game-changer. It’s not just about securing funds but about finding partners who contribute more than just capital to your venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Proptech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrapped up our discussion, we reflected on the future of Proptech and its inevitable intertwining with climate tech. This sector is not just about innovative technology; it's also about driving meaningful change in one of the world's most fundamental industries – real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode closed with an optimistic outlook for Proptech startups. Despite the varying challenges, the opportunities in this space are immense. The key lies in understanding market dynamics, aligning with the right partners, and staying committed to the vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="proptech"></category><category term="fundraising"></category></entry><entry><title>The growth of EV contractors in California</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/the-growth-of-ev-contractors-in-california/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-01:/blog/the-growth-of-ev-contractors-in-california/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this final article of our series on EV charger activity in California, we explore the growth of EV charger contractors. We highlight the flourishing EV charger space and provide examples of companies operating in different parts of the ecosystem. Additionally, we showcase the jurisdictions with the most active EV charger contractors and analyze the increasing trend of new contractor activity. The data underscores the growing demand for EV chargers and the expanding market for contractors in this exciting industry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Growth in EV charger contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the final article of our recent series on EV charger activity in California. You can also read about the &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;growth of EV chargers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;EV charger permit approval timelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen the EV charger space flourish, with companies operating in many different parts of the ecosystem. Check out a few examples::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger hardware companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evocharge.com/"&gt;EvoCharge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evercharge.com/"&gt;EverCharge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evbox.com/en/"&gt;EVBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger software companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://chargelab.co/"&gt;ChargeLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://driivz.com/"&gt;Driivz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noodoe.com/"&gt;NooDoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ampup.io/"&gt;AmpUp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger services companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kopperfield.com/"&gt;Kopperfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://treehouse.pro/"&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://elephantenergy.com/"&gt;Elephant Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.quitcarbon.com/"&gt;QuitCarbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And charge point operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evgo.com/"&gt;EVGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/"&gt;Electrify America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/commercial-charging"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also sales and design tools like &lt;a href="https://www.monterra.ai/"&gt;Monterra&lt;/a&gt;, purpose-built to help installers (electrical contractors and EV charging project developers) design, quote, and propose projects faster - streamlining and automating an otherwise manual site design and sales process. It’s a busy space! That’s why we’re spending so much time looking into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already showed that there’s been a boon in EV charger installs. With all of this activity, it seems that there should be an increase in contractor activity, too. That’s what we set out to prove, and the data says it loud and clear: the number of contractors doing EV charger installations is increasing throughout California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things into context, nearly 30% of all EV chargers in the US are installed in California today, followed by NY, FL, TX, MA, and WA (making up 25% collectively). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Stay tuned, as we’ll soon dive into the data for FL and TX market in a future post!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the jurisdictions with the most active EV charger contractors since 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacramento County&lt;/strong&gt;: 429 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkeley&lt;/strong&gt;: 209 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encinitas&lt;/strong&gt;: 203 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oakland&lt;/strong&gt;: 140 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anaheim&lt;/strong&gt;: 119 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the top two jurisdictions and looked to see if the number of active EV charger contractors has been increasing over time. Indeed it has! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-sacramento.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-sacramento.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-berkeley.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-berkeley.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend line shows that in Sacramento, another EV charger contractor has become active every quarter. In Berkeley, it’s another 1.5 contractors active each quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkeley and Sacramento have the most active contractors. In jurisdictions with fewer contractors, is the rate of new activity higher? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-grid.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-grid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower the base, the higher the slope, with dramatic recent increases in contractor activity in Anaheim, Sacramento, and Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Sacramento (City) and Sacramento County are different permitting jurisdictions, so there’s no overlap here in the charts.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that there should be an increase in &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; EV charger contractors intrigued us, so we did that analysis, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="new-ev-contractors.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/new-ev-contractors.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart shows the number of new contractors entering each of the jurisdictions each year. A new contractor is one that had no permit history in the years prior. You can see an acceleration happening between 2010 and 2022 as these jurisdictions add more &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; EV charger contractors each year. Anaheim is the outlier. They started high and stayed high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EV charger market is growing at an increasing rate.&lt;/strong&gt; Supply of contractors (as well as hardware, software, and services) is responding to an increase in demand, and we can track this response using Shovels building permit data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we figured that another sign of market growth could be EV contractors expanding their own territories. We decided to look at the percentage of EV contractors doing work in multiple jurisdictions each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="multiple-jurisdictions-ev-contractors.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/multiple-jurisdictions-ev-contractors.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geographical expansion is also trending up, with a big surge during COVID that sustained after the pandemic retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool stuff, right? This means EV charging is hot. Dare we say &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a good market to work and invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited by all of this data, and we want you to be excited too. Want to do your own epic analysis of the building trades? Get in touch: sales@shovels.ai.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing inspiration from April Dunford's book "Obviously Awesome," they explore how positioning can significantly impact the success and perception of a product. The episode uses a compelling analogy of a bakery specializing in chocolate cake to demonstrate how different positioning (cake, muffin, lollipop) can create entirely different market segments and customer perceptions, even with the same product.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/A-Peek-at-Positioning-e2ap6fp/a-aage57p" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of property technology (proptech), understanding and mastering the art of positioning can be the difference between success and obscurity. In our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando and I delve into this critical business strategy, drawing parallels between a simple bakery product and complex proptech solutions. This comparison, inspired by insights from April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome," sheds light on how strategic positioning can make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bakery Analogy: A Lesson in Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine walking into a bakery that sells the most delicious chocolate cake. This cake is their flagship product, the crown jewel of their culinary expertise. Now, picture this cake being sold not just as a cake but also as a muffin or even a lollipop. This is where the concept of positioning comes into play. It's about how you frame and market your product to target different segments and create diverse customer perceptions, even if the core product remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of proptech, this analogy translates into how companies position their products or services in the market. It's not just about what you offer; it's about how you present it to your audience and how they perceive its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels: An Evolution in Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels journey serves as a prime example of effective positioning. Initially positioned as an API provider, the company recognized the need to pivot towards a more market-driven offering. By rebranding themselves as a go-to-market solution for lead generation, Shovels was able to tap into a more lucrative and relevant market segment. This shift wasn't just a change in our marketing strategy; it was a strategic move that aligned our product with the evolving needs of our customers and the market at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evolution in positioning demonstrates the importance of being agile and responsive to market trends. Shovels listened to customer feedback, understood the changing landscape of proptech, and adapted their positioning accordingly. It's a testament to the fact that in the fast-paced world of technology, flexibility and adaptability are key to survival and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aikito: Adapting to Market Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aikito's story is another compelling case of strategic positioning. Initially offering financing solutions, the company pivoted to providing project management and contractor connections. This change was driven by a deep understanding of their customers' evolving needs and the market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aikito's shift highlights a critical aspect of positioning: it's an ongoing process. As markets change and customer needs evolve, so must the positioning of products and services. Aikito's ability to adapt and reposition itself allowed the company to stay relevant and competitive in the dynamic proptech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Aligning with Customer Needs and Market Trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway from our episode is the importance of aligning your product's positioning with customer needs and market trends. In proptech, where technology and customer preferences are constantly evolving, staying attuned to these changes is crucial. Whether it's through customer feedback, market research, or industry trends, understanding the ecosystem in which your product exists is vital for effective positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning is not just a one-time marketing exercise; it's a strategic decision that influences every aspect of your business. It affects how you develop your product, engage with your customers, and ultimately, how your business is perceived in the market. In the fast-paced world of proptech, getting your positioning right can mean the difference between leading the market or lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the art of positioning in proptech, as illustrated through our bakery analogy, is about more than just marketing. It's about strategically aligning your product with the market and customer needs. It's about being adaptable, responsive, and always willing to evolve. As proptech continues to grow and change, those who master the art of positioning will be the ones who thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore the fascinating world of proptech, Fernando and I are excited to share more insights and learnings with you. Stay tuned for more episodes of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," where we delve into the trends, challenges, and opportunities shaping this dynamic industry!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="proptech"></category><category term="positioning"></category></entry><entry><title>How to use the Shovels API</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-13:/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels API provides an intuitive platform for proptech enthusiasts looking to leverage building permit data. Users can access and filter building activities via types or specific date ranges. The API employs 'tags' to categorize 33 distinct types of building activities.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So... you want to build something cool in proptech, and you figured out (wisely, I might add) that building permits will make your product &lt;em&gt;shine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is excellent news, and we are here to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use header key-based authentication. There are two steps to authenticate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your API key at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai" target="_blank"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; . You will see it on your dashboard when you register and log in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your key to this HTTP header when you make a request: &lt;code&gt;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-requests/#request-headers" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;  for more information about making HTTP requests with headers using Python. &lt;em&gt;(Note: you can use any programming language; we like Python 🐍)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned early on that our customers wanted two types of filters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By activity&lt;/strong&gt;: Filter building activity by the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By date&lt;/strong&gt;: Show the activity in between two dates, and always display the most recent activity first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the building activity filter first. We call types of activity &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer 33 unique tags as of this publication date in October 2023. That number will increase over time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use tags, you need to know what they are. We named them to (hopefully) be self-explanatory. If you need clarification, you can check the Tags tab in the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit#gid=1842205445" target="_blank"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; . We'll try to keep this updated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see a list programmatically, perhaps for your own internal dashboard or BI tool, you can always list our tags using the &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/List/operation/get_all_available_tags_v1_list_tags_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get All Available Tags&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this extra super clear, let's go through some examples. I'm going to show the code snippets using Curl, a command-line tool available natively in every operating system. Just open a new command-line prompt (e.g. Terminal on MacOS) to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get details on every heat pump installation in a zip code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use 94123, my old neighborhood in San Francisco. Start by finding the right tag (using the methodology above) for heat pumps: &lt;code&gt;heat_pump&lt;/code&gt; should do the trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, find the endpoint. &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_zip_code_v1_permits_zip_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits By Zip Code&lt;/a&gt;  sounds about right! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the request. Here's the Curl command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/zip?zip_code=94123&amp;amp;tags=heat_pump&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -H &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -H &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;items&amp;quot;: [
    {
      &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;07ec97288669e01793a9dbb47c352400&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;address&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;3550&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;BAKER ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;SAN FRANCISCO&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;94123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;: 37.804016,
        &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;: -122.44678
      }
    },
    {
      &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;address&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;12&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;RICO WAY&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;SAN FRANCISCO&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;94123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;: 37.805016,
        &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;: -122.438484
      }
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do with all those &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; values? Each one is an internal ID for a Shovels permit. To get the details we want (since we probably want more than just the address) let's take the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and pass it into our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permit_by_id_v1_permits__id__get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permit by ID&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -H &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -H &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we get this in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;jurisdiction&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;San&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Francisco&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;issue_date&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;2017-09-07&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;final_date&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;null,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;Plumbing&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;inspections_pass_rate&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;null,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;fees&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;null,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;address_id&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;1973404EE7003B21&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;Work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;rooftop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;heatpump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;ductwork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;rooftop,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;24,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;btu&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;contractor_id&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;null,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;PMW20170907784&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;status&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;Active&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;RICO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;WAY&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;SAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;FRANCISCO&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;94123&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;37.805016,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;long&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-122.438484&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;air_source_heat_pump&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;heat_pump&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;utilities&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neato! If we wanted to store all these heat pump installs in a database or spreadsheet, we could write more code for that. I recommend asking ChatGPT to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get all the heat pump HVAC installers in a zip code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don't care about the permits or the homes, and you just want to know who did the install? We can help with that, too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our handy &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractors_by_activity_zipcode_v1_contractors_activity_zip_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits By Activity Zip Code&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint should be perfect. We can use the same example, and we'll introduce dates this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this API call, let's find all the heat pump HVAC installers who did work in the first two quarters of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/contractors/activity/zip?zip_code=94103&amp;amp;tags=heat_pump&amp;amp;start_date=2023-01-01&amp;amp;end_date=2023-07-01&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that our dates take the form &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/code&gt;. This is important!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response now is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;DENIZ SALON&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;business_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;KA - BI CONSTRUCTION INC.&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal. The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; shown is our internal Shovels contractor ID. Let's hit our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractor_by_id_v1_contractors__id__get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Contractor by Id&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint with it to get those contractor details! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/contractors/adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the details are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;license&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;944398&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;business_name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;KA - BI CONSTRUCTION INC.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;phone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;6502914299&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;1290&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;BURLINGAME&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permits have dates galore. We show file dates, issue dates, and final dates. File dates are when the permit was sent to the jurisdiction. Issue dates are when the permits are approved for construction, and the final dates is when the jurisdiction finally signs off on the finished work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our date filters, called &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end_date&lt;/code&gt;, are based solely on the file date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how this works, let's look at permits filed in New York in August 2023. We can use our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_state_v1_permits_state_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits by State&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/state?state=NY&amp;amp;start_date=2023-08-01&amp;amp;end_date=2023-08-31&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could use tags here too, but I chose not to. Here's what the first two permits look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;e101ca8b62f825a1199fb370365b85d7&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;address&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;NEW HAMPSHIRE AVE&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;EAST GREENBUSH&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;12144&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;NY&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;: 42.625023,
    &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;: -73.725845
  }
},
{
  &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;d0c345961c8c446f3e56655c0ddfca8a&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;address&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;410&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ROCKAWAY AVE&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;HEMPSTEAD&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;11581&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;NY&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;: 40.658535,
    &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;: -73.70126
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could look up the details on these the same way I described above. No need to repeat! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API is meant to be fast to learn and easy to work with. If you have any questions (really!) we want to know and provide support so we can make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you find that you're looking for an endpoint that we're not offering yet, let us know. We just might build it. &lt;/p&gt;

Our new web application is going to have more features to find contractors, look up permits, and get all the permits on any address in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This will be a newsletter about using the Shovels building permit API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a new war began since our last newsletter, and I think first of the children. I don't know how to help other than to put this little mention in this little newsletter and try to stay positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that... back to permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, I said we'd work on loading every state into the API. This month, I get to tell you it's done! Yay! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To celebrate this launch, we're making it easier to get API keys. You don't need to ask us first. Just register an account with &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;our sweet new app&lt;/a&gt; and get your API key 💪&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't know how to use an API? That's cool, for most of my life, I didn't either. I have a solution for you, too. Read below. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do like APIs, don't forget about our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;pretty API docs&lt;/a&gt; 😍 and check out our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;API starter guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🇺🇸 The API is national 🇺🇸&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 100 million permits span:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24,593,329 addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14,688 zip codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;973 jurisdictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;656 counties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And across all of these permits we applied 33 unique "tags" in order to make it easy to cluster and slice these 100 million permits to your liking... &lt;strong&gt;all by using the Shovels API&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API wuh? 🤔&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my attempt at writing the shortest-ever tutorial on how to use an API. We have a more detailed &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;tutorial on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is like a set of defined questions you can ask a database using your favorite programming language. Each of these questions is called an "endpoint." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can ask &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_address_v1_permits_address_get"&gt;this endpoint&lt;/a&gt; the question, "What are all the permits on 15 Cherry Lane, Anytown, MD?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_zip_code_v1_permits_zip_get"&gt;this endpoint&lt;/a&gt; the question, "Which homes in the zip code 94123 pulled ADU permits in the last 6 months?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on... each endpoint is purpose-built for you to ask a certain type of question. The questions our endpoints can answer are described in our &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;lovely API documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything's unclear, please holler at me! I'll be happy to share my screen as we do some programming together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API keys galore&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always thought that to be truly developer-friendly, a company should not stand in between developers and the API. The docs should be great, the API should be fast, and when inspiration strikes, software developers shouldn't have to wait for an API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've built an app to give you an API key whenever you want one. Just make an account at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;. You'll see your shiny new API key on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We built this thing for the web using a new mobile app technology called Flutter. That means we're going to release native mobile apps, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 million building permits in your pocket, coming soon to an app store near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="App screenshot" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/app-auth-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Spreadsheets for the rest of us&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone knows what JSON is. Even those in tech might think I omitted a vowel from the name of a popular YouTuber / investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I have a solution. We will run CSV files you as you need them, one-off or monthly, for roughly the same price as our API. We won't give you the entire database, but we'll accommodate you if you'll accommodate a monthly subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSV files are super convenient and until we have a self-serve solution for you to query and download your own CSVs, we'll be happy to do it for you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pricing page is live&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I always save this section for last? I dunno! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't give this data away for free. If you start using your API key, we will start asking you to pay for it. Pricing is going to be reasonable, though. The shared goal here is for you to use Shovels data and be absolutely thrilled with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our pricing (with some minor updates from last time) here: &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/pricing"&gt;https://www.shovels.ai/pricing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/pricing"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We emphasized the importance of attitude, potential, communication skills, and cultural fit over traditional qualifications. Our discussion highlighted how diverse backgrounds, passion, and adaptability are key to building a successful team in the dynamic world of proptech.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Is-it-possible-to-hire-well-reliably-e2b26me/a-aaha9b0" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fourth episode of our podcast, "What I Learned This Week In Proptech," we delved into a vital aspect of any business, especially in the fast-paced world of proptech: hiring the right talent. Fernando and I discussed our experiences and insights, offering a fresh perspective on this challenging yet crucial process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the Importance of Attitude over Pedigree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first lessons we've learned is the paramount importance of attitude over academic pedigree. In proptech, where innovation and adaptability are key, a candidate's mindset can often be a greater asset than their educational background. This approach is particularly pertinent in startups, where a flexible and positive attitude is crucial for navigating the uncertain waters of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Art of Identifying Potential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying potential in candidates can be challenging, and we often find that traditional markers like academic achievements or previous job titles don't always paint the full picture. We've learned to look deeper, seeking signs of creativity, problem-solving abilities, and a genuine passion for proptech. These qualities often indicate a candidate's ability to grow and adapt within a dynamic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of 'Homework' in the Hiring Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assigning 'homework' or practical tasks during the hiring process can be a valuable tool. This approach allows us to assess a candidate's real-world skills and how they approach problem-solving. It's an effective way to gauge not only their technical abilities but also their commitment and enthusiasm for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Writing Skills Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the remote working environment that dominates proptech, clear and effective communication is essential. We place a high value on writing skills, as they are often indicative of a candidate's ability to think clearly and communicate effectively, both of which are critical in a fast-moving and often complex industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Value of Diverse Backgrounds and Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proptech, innovation is key, and diverse backgrounds can be a significant asset. We've learned to value candidates who bring different perspectives and experiences to the table. This diversity fosters a culture of creativity and can lead to innovative solutions and approaches in the proptech space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Balancing Technical Skills with Cultural Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technical skills are undoubtedly important, we've learned that a candidate's fit within the team and the company culture is equally vital. We look for individuals who not only have the necessary skills but who also share our passion for proptech and our vision for the future of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Passion and Curiosity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion and curiosity are qualities we highly value in candidates. Individuals who are genuinely excited about proptech and continually seek to learn and grow within the field are likely to be valuable assets to our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embracing Flexibility and Adaptability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proptech industry is ever-evolving, and we need team members who can adapt to changes and embrace new challenges. Flexibility and adaptability are crucial traits that we look for in candidates, as they are essential for success in a dynamic and rapidly changing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Crafting a Successful Team in Proptech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a successful team in proptech requires a nuanced approach to hiring. By focusing on attitude, potential, communication skills, and cultural fit, and by valuing diversity, passion, and adaptability, we can assemble a team capable of driving innovation and success in the proptech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore and learn in the world of proptech, these hiring strategies will remain central to our efforts in cultivating a dynamic and effective team, ready to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead in this exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="no-code"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 5: Navigating the sales and CRM landscape in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-5-navigating-the-sales-and-crm-landscape-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-27:/blog/episode-5-navigating-the-sales-and-crm-landscape-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the fifth episode of our podcast, we explore the unique challenges of sales and CRM strategies in the proptech industry. We discuss the importance of aligning sales approaches with diverse customer needs and behaviors, and the impact of CRM choices on a company's workflow and culture. The conversation highlights the significance of structured customer relationship management in driving the success of proptech ventures.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Moving-Down-the-Funnel---Sales-Motion-and-CRM-e2baf5f/a-aai3thu" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our exploration of the dynamic world of proptech. In this fifth podcast episode, Fernando and I dive deep into the sales cycle unique to proptech and the critical role of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems in this niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proptech industry, with its distinct sales cycle and customer profiles, requires a nuanced approach to sales and CRM utilization. As a proptech / climate tech founder, I grapple with questions surrounding the uniqueness of selling in proptech. What sets it apart? How do the competitive environment, pricing constraints, and urgency affect sales strategies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando, my co-host and seasoned author and expert in sales, helps unpack these complexities. We discuss the importance of understanding different customer segments in proptech – from small businesses to large enterprises – and how their varying needs impact the sales process. For instance, an enterprise client might have different contract values and buying behaviors than a smaller business, dramatically influencing the sales approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key takeaway from our discussion is the significance of aligning sales strategies with customer needs and behaviors. This alignment is crucial for effective go-to-market strategies. As we transitioned the conversation to CRM systems, it was clear that the choice of CRM can profoundly influence a company's culture and workflow. This choice can make or break the efficiency of sales processes, especially in a nuanced field like proptech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating part of our conversation revolved around the use of different CRMs. While I shared my experience with Pipedrive, emphasizing its ease of integration with Google Workspace and its cost-effectiveness, Fernando provided insights into the use of HubSpot, highlighting its robust marketing and sales hubs. This difference in choice underscores the varied needs of proptech businesses and the necessity to tailor CRM solutions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion also touched upon the importance of considering territorial aspects in sales and the potential cost implications of hiring proptech sales professionals. Understanding the local nature of proptech sales is vital, as the industry often revolves around specific geographic locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our conversation underscored a fundamental truth: in proptech, as in any industry, a deep understanding of your customer segments, coupled with the right technological tools, is key to successful sales and marketing strategies. For any proptech entrepreneurs out there, our advice is clear – invest in a CRM system that aligns with your business needs and embrace the nuances of selling in this unique industry early in your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every conversation should in your CRM, one way or the other," Fernando aptly notes. This simple yet powerful statement is a reminder of the critical role that structured, efficient customer relationship management plays in the success of any proptech venture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="sales"></category><category term="crm"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 6: Revitalizing urban landscapes in the age of proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-6-revitalizing-urban-landscapes-in-the-age-of-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-02:/blog/episode-6-revitalizing-urban-landscapes-in-the-age-of-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Episode 6 of "What I Learned This Week In Proptech," we explored the transformative trends in urban real estate, particularly in downtown areas like San Francisco. The discussion covered the rising vacancy rates, innovative repurposing of commercial spaces, and the evolving concept of coworking. We highlighted the significance of community in these transformations and contemplated the role of local government in shaping the future of urban landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/A-Changing-Real-Estate-Landscape-e2bik2p/a-aaissjg" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest episode of our podcast, "What I Learned This Week In Proptech," Fernando and I delved into the rapidly evolving landscape of urban real estate, focusing on the transformation of downtown areas. We discussed how changes in work patterns and the economic climate reshaped urban centers, especially in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Downtown Areas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We operated in a space that was changing really quickly," Fernando said, highlighting the dynamic nature of real estate in today's world. The episode kicked off with a discussion about the future of downtown areas, particularly in the context of changing work patterns. Fernando shared his observations on how these shifts visibly impacted San Francisco, our home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Real Estate Downturn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One striking point I raised was the alarming vacancy rates in San Francisco - surpassing 30%. This trend was not just a local phenomenon but a broader reflection of the global shifts in the real estate market. "It's kind of like one of those Y2K level thresholds that you just don't want to be passed," I noted, drawing parallels between the current real estate situation and past significant events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repurposing Commercial Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key part of our discussion revolved around the innovative repurposing of traditional commercial spaces. Fernando mentioned Aikito's involvement in such projects, emphasizing the importance of community in reimagining these spaces. "Community was the thing that was missing since the pandemic and it's what was missing when you work from home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Francisco's Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, there were signs of resilience and adaptation in San Francisco.

They discussed the variations in permits across states, the insights gained from analyzing permit data, and the practical implications for businesses and property technology. The episode highlighted the importance of understanding permit trends and regulations in commercial construction and renovation projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Everything-You-Didnt-Know-About-Building-Permits-e2bnefv/a-aajc8k4" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our latest installment of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech." In this episode, Fernando Pizarro and I, Ryan Buckley, delve into a topic that's both fascinating and crucial in the realm of property technology: commercial building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a building permit might seem straightforward at first glance, but as we explored, it's anything but. We started by defining what a building permit is. Essentially, it's a document issued by local government authorities to regulate and track construction activities. This aspect of local regulation is vital because building standards and requirements can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. As I often say, the devil is in the details, and in the case of building permits, those details are critical for ensuring public safety and compliance with local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando brought up an interesting point about the variety of permits available. Indeed, a building permit can refer to many different things, and this diversity is a crucial aspect of understanding the landscape of commercial building permits. What we find fascinating is how these permits serve as a gateway to a wealth of data and insights into construction activities, contractor histories, and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our discussion, we uncovered some intriguing insights, particularly about commercial permits. For instance, the proportion of commercial permits varies significantly across states. Surprisingly, states like Alaska have a higher percentage of commercial permits relative to residential ones, likely due to the lower overall number of residential permits. This finding led us to consider the implications of such data for businesses and contractors operating in different states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifted to the practical applications of this data. For instance, by analyzing permits, we can identify trends in commercial construction, such as the prevalence of electrical work or the surprisingly low incidence of HVAC-related projects. These insights are invaluable for businesses and contractors looking to capitalize on market demands or for those in the property technology industry seeking to understand where their services might be most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more striking revelations from our analysis was the significant variation in the time taken to approve commercial permits across different states. New York, for example, stood out with an average approval time of over 500 days for commercial permits, a stark contrast to states like California and Texas, where the process is considerably quicker. This kind of information is crucial for businesses planning construction or renovation projects, as it directly impacts project timelines and budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando, drawing on his experience with Aikito, provided valuable insights into how this data applies to real-world scenarios. He noted the importance of understanding these permit trends, especially in the context of renovations and conversions of existing spaces, which is a significant part of Aikito's focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our deep dive into commercial building permits revealed a complex and nuanced landscape. These permits are more than just bureaucratic necessities; they are a lens through which we can view and understand market trends, regulatory environments, and the ever-evolving world of property technology. As always, we aim to demystify these topics, providing our listeners with valuable insights and practical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="building permit"></category><category term="building contractor"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 8: Navigating commercial buildouts</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-8-navigating-commercial-buildouts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-15:/blog/episode-8-navigating-commercial-buildouts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Episode 8 of "What We Learned This Week In Proptech," Fernando Pizarro and I explored the intricate process of commercial buildouts, discussing the importance of choosing the right space, the role of brokers, architects, and contractors, and the complexities of permitting. We also highlighted the transformative impact of technology in streamlining these processes, reflecting on the potential efficiencies it brings to the proptech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Opening-a-Restaurant-for-Dummies-e2c1bke/a-aakbtbq" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week on "What We Learned This Week In Proptech," Fernando and I delved into the intricate world of commercial buildouts. This topic, particularly close to Fernando's heart, unraveled the journey of a chef with a unique restaurant concept, ready to transform vision into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discussion began with the initial stages of a commercial buildout, where the focus lies heavily on finding and outfitting a suitable space. "It's all about turning that concept into a tangible reality," said Fernando, highlighting the importance of selecting the right location and designing the space to fit the unique needs of a business, like our chef's innovative chicken finger restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifted to my experiences at Chubbles, where the week had been a mix of successes and challenges. The excitement of new subscriptions contrasted with the delays in releasing our national contractor API. "The main headache has been around infrastructure and release cycles," I said, emphasizing the complexities in technology deployment in proptech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared his insights on the role of commercial brokers, crucial in navigating the complex landscape of commercial real estate. "Brokers are essential in linking clients with architects, contractors, and negotiating lease terms," Fernando explained. However, he also cautioned about the delicate balance of brokers' incentives, particularly when negotiating work letters that define the condition of the leased space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discussed the role of architects and general contractors in the buildout process. "Their expertise becomes pivotal once a space is chosen," I noted, underlining the importance of these professionals in the preliminary planning and execution stages. Fernando added, "It's a highly collaborative process involving numerous stakeholders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key takeaways from our discussion was the significance of permits in the buildout process. "Permitting can be a complex and time-consuming stage," Fernando said, stressing the need for early engagement with architects and contractors to ensure compliance and avoid delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conversation wound down, we touched upon the impact of technology in streamlining the buildout process. Fernando pointed out, "Tech platforms can significantly reduce time and complexity, bringing efficiency to a traditionally manual process." This insight aligns with the emerging trends in proptech, where technology integration is revolutionizing traditional practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="commercial permit"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Do rebate programs matter to contractors in the SF Bay Area?</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/do-rebate-programs-matter-to-contractors-in-the-sf-bay-area/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-19:/blog/do-rebate-programs-matter-to-contractors-in-the-sf-bay-area/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We look at the impact of BayREN's initiatives on the Bay Area's energy upgrade trends, revealing a significant increase in heat pump installations by BayREN-affiliated contractors compared to a lesser focus on solar panel installations. It suggests that BayREN is strategically filling gaps in the building electrification market.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A key player in the building electrification transformation in the San Francisco Bay Area is the &lt;a href="https://www.bayren.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Bay Area Regional Energy Network&lt;/a&gt; (BayREN). Over the past decade it has become synonymous with fostering environmentally conscious decisions among communities and building contractors alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recent research into building permits has revealed compelling trends that not only underscore BayREN's influence but also signal a shift in the region's approach to energy efficiency. By analyzing building permits, we discovered a stark difference in the uptake of various energy upgrades between contractors affiliated with BayREN and those who are not. This isn't just numerical variance; it's a narrative about where we're heading and what fuels our journey towards a greener Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bayren vs other contractors" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/contractors_comparison_chart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data paints a telling picture: BayREN contractors are installing significantly more heat pumps than their non-affiliated counterparts. Why heat pumps? Heat pumps are a linchpin in the arsenal against energy inefficiency. They serve dual purposes, providing heating and cooling in a single system, and they're remarkably efficient, actually cutting down total energy use compared to traditional HVAC systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns perfectly with BayREN's strategic priorities. By streamlining the installation of heat pumps, BayREN is not just pushing for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; it's also promoting a technology that can adapt to and leverage the Bay Area's mild climate, proving to be both a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for local homeowners and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same research indicated that BayREN contractors install fewer solar panels than their peers. This could seem counterintuitive at first glance, given the solar industry's growth and the region's ample sunshine. However, this trend could be attributed to several factors. Perhaps the solar market in the Bay Area is already well-developed, necessitating less intervention. Alternatively, it could be that BayREN's current initiatives are designed to fill gaps in the building electrification market where other technologies, such as heat pumps, have yet to mature. It's also possible that the existing financial incentives for solar installations are already optimized, so BayREN focuses its resources on other technologies in need of a push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to electric vehicle (EV) charger installations, the numbers align closely between BayREN contractors and others. EV technology is an area of robust growth, supported by statewide initiatives and private investments alike. The parallel trends here suggest that the push for EV infrastructure might be equally strong across the board, indicating that BayREN's efforts in this domain are complementing an already thriving market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do these trends mean for the Bay Area's energy landscape? They showcase BayREN's role in helping the region's energy efficiency trajectory. By fostering the adoption of heat pumps, BayREN is helping to redefine the standard for residential and commercial heating and cooling systems. This not only contributes to lowering carbon footprints but also aligns with broader goals of resilience and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also prompts a re-evaluation of solar energy's place in the Bay Area's proptech scene. With the solar panel market potentially approaching saturation, it may be time to innovate further or redirect focus to complementing technologies that enhance solar efficiency or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings illuminate the nuanced dynamics of energy upgrades in the Bay Area. As BayREN continues to lead with forward-thinking programs, it remains crucial for us to monitor how these initiatives shape both the demand and the labor market to install these systems. The shifts we see today, influenced by BayREN's strategic decisions, are creating a blueprint for other regions to follow. And as we continue to gather data and analyze trends, we look forward to contributing the conversation around proptech and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="bayren"></category><category term="rebates"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 9: Exploring AI in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-9-exploring-ai-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-21:/blog/episode-9-exploring-ai-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our latest podcast episode we discuss the evolving role of artificial intelligence in the proptech industry.

And we're doing a lot of data enrichment!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can now look up permits by type and ZIP code or by postal address using &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;the Shovels app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is not to build the killer building permit SaaS app (that may come later). It's just to help you understand what's sitting in our database and give you some ideas about what to do with this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since permits are tied to contractors, contractor profiles will start to appear here as well 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-screenshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: see where contractors work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to Yelp, or Thumbtack, or Porch, or Angi, or any of those guys to find an electrician "near me," you'll get a list of electricians whose business address is near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not really how electricians and other trades work. They travel! They don't stick to the same ZIP code as their business address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp et al, therefore, won't recommend the best electrician working in your neighborhood. Those guys have no clue who &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; in your neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But we do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractors_by_activity_zipcode_v1_contractors_activity_zip_get"&gt;API endpoint&lt;/a&gt; to find the most active heat pump (etc, etc) contractor that works in your ZIP code. We'll add a basic interface to the Shovels app to show you this too. Or if you want a sample CSV report, just reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Heat pumps galore ☀️&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's undeniable that the world is getting hotter. We can debate how much humanity is at fault, but the increase in worldwide average temperature and all the trouble that causes is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whodunnit, there's a new crop of well-funded "climate tech" startups trying to prevent the impacts from getting worse. Shovels is here to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winds are shifting towards electric home appliances, and with that comes a tremendous business opportunity. Our timing here is perfect: the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 is going to hit the markets in 2024. That means a TON of building electrification permits (heat pumps, EV chargers, batteries, and solar) and installations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also means a lot of innovation and technology which will be visible in data that Shovels is uniquely capable of collecting. We intend to be the de facto leader in building electrification data going into next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's why I'm excited. Here's a worthwhile &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/business/energy-environment/heat-pumps-biden-tax-credits-rebates.html?unlocked_article_code=1.90w.qsq1.QP6pmedG0WQU&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; all about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now what?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things! I'll mention a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better contact info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're partnering with a B2B and B2C data company to fill in homeowner and contractor contact details where they're missing on permits. We're also appending homeowner data fields like job title and seniority level, marital status, and much more. On the contractor side, we're improving phone and email coverage, as well as business websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result: some crazy awesome filtering for lead generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could run online ads to everyone with a solar panel installation? Or an ADU? Or any kind of remodel in the last 5 years? We're partnering with two platforms that can take our permit data online and build lookalike audiences to expand your reach. Let me know if you're interested!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax assessor data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it'd be pretty great to have all the tax assessor data (home value, lot size, number of stories, etc) alongside the building permit and building contractor data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with the better contact info, I believe this will put Shovels second to none in the proptech lead gen category 💯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very curious what you think of the above.

&lt;p&gt;The episode also touched on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which I believe plays a crucial role in this sector. "It's pumping a lot of money, tens of billions of dollars, specifically into the intersection of climate tech and property tech," I said, underscoring the significant financial backing fueling these industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then explored the emerging trend of virtual power plants and the role of software in managing and distributing energy across the grid. This highlights the increasing need for technology in efficiently utilizing renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared insights on New York's Local Law 97, which mandates buildings to reduce carbon emissions. This law has sparked a surge in interest for solutions that proptech startups can provide, demonstrating the regulatory push towards sustainable practices in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our conversation circled back to the significance of being mission-driven in the tech industry, especially in the realms of proptech and climate tech. "It's really nice to be mission driven," I reflected, emphasizing the satisfaction derived from working towards a greater good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="climatetech"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 12: Navigating culture in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-12-navigating-culture-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-12-13:/blog/episode-12-navigating-culture-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Episode 12 of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech" podcast with Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro delves into the intricacies of company culture in proptech. They discuss its impact on decision-making, diversity, and sustainability, underscoring its essential role in shaping company dynamics and future growth.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 12th episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando Pizarro and I delved into the nuanced and pivotal role of culture in the proptech industry. We explored how culture underpins decision-making and influences company dynamics, particularly in tech startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about culture, a subject that is near and dear to my heart," Fernando began, emphasizing culture's omnipresence in every facet of a company. I echoed this sentiment, noting that culture occurs whether intentionally cultivated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant part of our discussion revolved around how culture guides hard decisions. Fernando believed that culture comes to the forefront when making trade-offs. "Culture is what you fall back on when there's a tough call to make," he said, highlighting its foundational role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared insights from the EconTalk podcast, which resonated with our topic. Andrew McAfee's thoughts on culture simplified it to 'how decisions are made.' This idea of constrained optimization, choosing paths when you can't do everything, resonated with both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation then shifted to how culture shapes companies' approach to diversity and inclusion. I shared my  view on this, favoring equality of opportunity over outcome. "I am a big believer of recruiting from non-traditional sources," I mentioned, discussing how varying perspectives enrich company culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando and I also touched on sustainability in proptech. Although sustainability isn't the only focus for my current business, its significance in the industry and its future role in our company culture were acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode concluded with reflections on the evolution of company culture. As Fernando and I shared our experiences and learnings, it was evident that culture, whether meticulously crafted or naturally evolved, is a cornerstone in the success and identity of proptech companies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="culture"></category><category term="hr"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2024 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/january-2024-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-04:/blog/january-2024-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A custom GPT, millions of new permits and hundreds of thousands of new contractors. This is a major update to our database and the way you can access it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nice, I get to be the 32nd person to wish you a happy new year in a marketing newsletter 🤗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let's get down to business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the help of ChatGPT, we are officially putting the AI in Shovels.ai. Preview &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;our custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; before it goes behind a paywall later this month. Tell it to look up some permits! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a bunch of new contractors and then de-duplicated them so searching by name is less confusing. We also improved the way permits are queried by zip code!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more things to do with permit data: calculate permit approval times (soon with even more granularity). &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;✨ Have you heard of ChatGPT? ✨&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be true that we are shovels.ai because the .com was taken, but we've always known artificial intelligence would play a major role here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI went and made doing that a whole lot easier by releasing custom GPTs late last year. These used to be called plugins, and they enable ChatGPT to interact with APIs like ours. So, we configured a custom GPT to use all of our API endpoints and &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;released it to the public&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear that OpenAI is going to release a GPT Store later this month. When that happens, we'll put the ShovelsAI GPT in there. But for now, anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account ($20/mo) can use our GPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, uhh... yea, it's pretty crazy. Here's what you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it an address in plain text and ask for the permits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for a certain type of permit (heat pump? roof? foundation?) in a zip code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it your address (or one nearby) and ask for a contractor recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell it to make a CSV from any result and give you a link to download it 😎 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to release some more endpoints so you can filter by permit status, fees, and such. We'll also make it easier to filter by city (we only do zips and states right now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're super excited about this new way to use Shovels! &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥳 A new product release worthy of 2024 🥳&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also thrilled to announce our latest data update. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Our jurisdiction, ZIP code, and city counts have increased, offering wider and more comprehensive data coverage:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jurisdictions: from 1,041 to 1,106&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP+4 codes: from 113,255 to 121,926&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities: from 41,582 to 46,813&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Permit Geolocations:&lt;/strong&gt; Three million additional permits are now precisely geo-located, enhancing the accuracy of location data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Contractors:&lt;/strong&gt; We increased the number of Shovels contractors by 17% to a total of 2.2M, covering 79K ZIP codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer Contractor Duplicates:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve grouped contractors that belong to the same entity within a state. Different branches should now be represented as one contractor company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More intuitive ZIP code queries:&lt;/strong&gt; Querying our API is now more straightforward and includes all +4 extension results even if you only provide 5-digit ZIP code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized Queries:&lt;/strong&gt; The introduction of materialized views has significantly boosted the efficiency and speed of API queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Pipeline Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabase Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Automation in QA and validation processes is enhanced through Metabase integration, offering immediate access to data insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Cleaning:&lt;/strong&gt; We've tightened our city cleaning process to ensure data accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Updating:&lt;/strong&gt; Our permit address verification is more robust than ever, thanks to the automation of external address source processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction Advancements:&lt;/strong&gt; Progress in extracting more accurate data from raw fields continues, improving the overall data quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallelism in Flows:&lt;/strong&gt; Processing efficiency has been boosted with further optimization of our data flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/dashboard.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: track approval times&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to listen to &lt;a href="https://www.capstonegov.com/podcast"&gt;these podcast interviews&lt;/a&gt; of city council members, mayors, and economic development staff in Contra Costa County, where I live. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I dig it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently, and I mean wayyy more than you'd think, these civic professionals talk about &lt;strong&gt;permit approval times&lt;/strong&gt;. The first mention was from the CEO of a local chamber of commerce. Then a very well connected commercial real estate broker said it. Then, once again, a local mayor mentioned how important this is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had coffee a few days ago with the CEO of a regional economic development agency out here and she too said permit approval times are critical data for city and county managers to track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels sees the permit file date and the issue date and can calculate the approval time. We did a &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;really thorough analysis&lt;/a&gt; of California EV charger permit processing times back in August. I plan to write another one on nationwide permit approval times next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some data from the midwest. What's going on, Louisville??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/midwest.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I'll announce some major progress on a new and improved web app. It's already looking awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers to 2024!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 13: The Sitzer/Burnett decision</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-13-the-sitzerburnett-decision/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-11:/blog/episode-13-the-sitzerburnett-decision/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Episode 13 of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando Pizarro and I delved into the Sitzer Burnett case which challenges the traditional commission-based system in real estate transactions. This lawsuit could potentially lead to a transformative change in the industry, paving the way for more efficient and consumer-friendly proptech innovations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-SitzerBurnett-Decision-e2elt8f/a-aas6e4k" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of property technology (proptech), 2024 has already marked itself as a year of significant developments. As we dive into the intricacies of these changes, particularly the Sitzer/Burnett case, it's clear that the traditional real estate industry is on the cusp of transformation. I explored these shifts in our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech" with Fernando Pizarro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year kicked off with an insightful discussion around a pivotal lawsuit, Sitzer Burnett, that's currently in the appeal process in Missouri. The crux of this case lies in challenging the commission-based system prevalent in real estate transactions. As consumers, we've been bound to this model, particularly in scenarios where sellers are compelled to pay the buyer agent's commission. This system, deeply ingrained in the industry, is facilitated by key players like the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the multiple listing service (MLS). The NAR's substantial membership and the exclusivity of MLS access to its members create a unique dynamic in the industry, one that's now under legal scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando and I discussed the monopolistic and cartel-like nature of this setup, where the NAR and MLS seemingly manipulate prices, inflating home costs and consequently harming consumers. A striking aspect of this lawsuit is the alleged 6% 'non-negotiable and anti-competitive' tax that costs consumers billions annually. This system essentially forces buyer agents into transactions, often inflating costs by significant percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on our personal experiences with real estate transactions, the sentiment towards this commission-based structure has long been one of skepticism. The prevalence of startups promoting 'For Sale By Owner' (FSBO) models highlights an ongoing resistance to traditional methods. These startups, along with platforms like Redfin or Zillow, challenge the necessity of buyer agents in an era where much of the preliminary house-hunting and negotiation can be conducted independently by buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the implications of the Sitzer Burnett case extend beyond just buyer-seller dynamics. Each MLS could potentially face its own lawsuit, as seen with subsequent cases in California. This legal pushback signifies a monumental shift that could dismantle the long-standing practices of the NAR and MLS. As Fernando noted, "it's going to be a ton of lawsuits that are going to be coming down the pike," driving significant behavioral change in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of this case could remake the industry, opening avenues for proptech companies to innovate and reshape real estate transactions. We see a future where AI could play a transformative role, potentially making traditional broker systems obsolete. AI, with its capability to analyze real estate data, legal requirements, and consumer preferences, could streamline transactions, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the changes aren't just confined to residential real estate. The commercial sector, including leasing, might also see increased transparency and disclosure of commission arrangements. This could directly impact my field at Shovels.ai, which deals with construction permits. The potential alignment of our services with evolving industry norms offers exciting possibilities for innovation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we navigate these changes, we must be nimble, keeping an eye on how our companies can leverage this upheaval. For proptech companies, this period is not just a challenge but an opportunity to redefine the industry, offering more transparent, efficient, and consumer-friendly solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the legal developments in the real estate industry signal a turning point for proptech. The dismantling of long-standing practices presents a unique opportunity for innovation and growth in the sector. As we at Shovels and other proptech companies observe these changes, we are looking to capitalize on an environment that promotes transparency, data access, and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="culture"></category><category term="supreme court"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 14: Davos and the DOE</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-14-davos-and-the-doe/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-18:/blog/episode-14-davos-and-the-doe/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a compelling episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro shared their unique experiences at Davos and a White House roundtable.

&lt;p&gt;The latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech" with Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro offered an intriguing juxtaposition of two distinct yet influential events: the World Economic Forum at Davos and a significant roundtable discussion hosted by the White House Office of Science, Transportation, and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando's experience at Davos was nothing short of fascinating. The event, known for its congregation of government, business, and non-governmental leaders, aimed at solving global issues, provided a platform for unprecedented networking and insights. Fernando’s interactions ranged from meeting the new president of the Club of Rome, a sustainability-focused organization, to engaging discussions on topics like AI and geopolitical happenings. The event's exclusivity, combined with its high-profile attendees, made for an environment rich in opportunities and spontaneous connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the globe, I had the privilege of virtually engaging with key figures from the White House and the Department of Energy. This engagement revolved around a pressing contemporary issue: building electrification and the challenges in obtaining permits for green infrastructure projects. The discussion highlighted the complexities of zoning changes, permit approvals, and the necessity for streamlined processes. This event underscored the critical role of proptech in facilitating green initiatives, a topic close to the heart of my work at Shovels.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both events, though contrasting in their settings, offered a shared theme: the need for innovation and collaboration in tackling global challenges. Fernando's insights from Davos emphasized the growing significance of sustainability and the urgent need for actionable solutions. My discussion with White House representatives echoed this sentiment, focusing on the bureaucratic challenges hindering progress in green infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast episode culminated in a rich exchange of ideas and experiences, illustrating the vast potential for proptech to contribute meaningfully to these global conversations.

&lt;p&gt;🥳 Today we invite you to sign up for our first major software release! 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone can register at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;! All you need is an email address. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's free for now. There still are a few bugs I know about, and you'll find a few more. It's free because I want your feedback. I figure we'll start charging for access before the next newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; is getting LOTS of use too. Who knew making building permit and contractor data accessible would be such a useful thing? (We did 😇)&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The case for software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels is a data company. That's our DNA. We're not very proficient (yet) at building software. We'll develop that skill as we go, but what will always set us apart is our devotion to clean, reliable, and useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched our nationwide &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits"&gt;building permit API&lt;/a&gt; in August 2023. We followed that release with a &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Contractors"&gt;nationwide contractor API&lt;/a&gt; in November 2023. We now have a bunch of paying customers and meaningful revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just getting this far is a big deal! And we'll continue to serve our current and new API customers. We ❤️ API deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as you know, the building trades are in transition. Many companies that have a clear, burning need for our data have no means to access it through an API. ChatGPT is great for figuring out what we offer and getting some samples, but it's not great for most commercial uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This all sounds good, Ryan," they would say. "Reach out again when you have software."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now we have software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥳 Introducing: Shovels app v1.0 🥳&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you too excited to continue reading? I get it. &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see it for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels app introduces our three data features: &lt;strong&gt;addresses&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;permits&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;contractors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-filter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot, we're looking up all active air source heat pump permits in California that mention the brand Mitsubishi. It's popular! I looked up Fujitsu (what we have) too and didn't see nearly as many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other potential uses are endless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for all new permits statewide last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all active commercial permits valued at over $1M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for wave pool permits (yes, somebody asked for this once)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download to a CSV straight from the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anywhere in the good ol' US of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, wouldn't it be interesting to see which contractors did these Mitsubishi heat pump installs? Click on a permit and you'll get to a permit profile page. On that profile page is (usually) going to be a contractor. Click and that, et voila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have contractor profiles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/shane.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see every permit that Shane Patrick O'Malley (don't know him, hope he's nice!) has worked on. Shane does a ton of work in San Francisco. If you're curious, you can click on each of his permits and learn everything you need to know about each job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more Shanes, hit the Contractors filter where you can look up all the heat pump installers in any ZIP code in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you just want to look up the permits on an address, you can do that too. Click on Addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/addresses.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the address profile page we're eventually going to show a bunch of property attributes, all of the permits, and all of the contractors. Contractor profiles are going to show a summary of all of their permits by type, stage, and eventually all of their business branches too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeesh. There's always so much more to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: even more heat pump contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0G9miWRDY"&gt;did a demo of Shovels&lt;/a&gt; for the GreenHome Institute, a 501 c3 nonprofit with a mission to empower people to make healthier and more sustainable choices in the renovation and construction of the places we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0G9miWRDY"&gt;really long, interesting conversation&lt;/a&gt;. We got into the nuts and bolts of how permit data works, and since there were many trades professionals in the audience, we got to go deep on how we classify permits and rate contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kr0G9miWRDY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1871"&gt;Scroll ahead to minute 31&lt;/a&gt; to see us dive into how the new Shovels app can help anyone find their perfect heat pump contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As implied, this is the start of a loooong development process. We've only just begun to build the killer building permits application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to look up a jurisdiction like Palo Alto and see everything in the permitting queue and get estimates on how long the review process will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to dive into building inspection results, even see who the inspector is, or see each step in the permit review process and how long it usually takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to filter for contractors by the number of heat pumps they've installed and how long it usually took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, it's all on the roadmap! Read even more detail in &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/"&gt;our launch post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. We're Silicon Valley famous: Here's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfY92Zk0S4Q&amp;amp;t=3448s"&gt;our mention on TWIST&lt;/a&gt; with Elizabeth Yin, Zach Coelius, and Jason Calacanis 😎&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry><entry><title>How to use the Shovels app</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-02-12:/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels app, a web application that provides access to building permit and contractor data, has been launched. The app, built using Google's Flutter technology, allows users to find and profile addresses, permits, and contractors. The application was developed in response to a market need for a user-friendly platform that doesn't require API knowledge. Future updates will include Android and iOS versions of the app, improved geocoding, and additional search and filter options. The app is priced at $499/month per account.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to announce the launch of V1 of &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;the Shovels app&lt;/a&gt;. This is a web application you can access on any desktop or mobile browser. Now you can access our building permit and contractor data without an API standing in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to share the history of how we got here and why building software is a pretty big deal for us. Then I’ll share what we’re releasing today and, importantly, what’s in store for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the Shovels API became an app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like data. It’s in our DNA. The founders, me and Luka, met over mobile data. We were both building separate companies, attacking the mobile data market from different angles. We combined the companies so we could offer a more complete picture of the mobile data environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first hire, Petra, is a data engineer. She brought some big company experience with her, largely from the firmographic (company) data market. She also liked the challenge of making real-world data more accessible and useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that’s what we’re doing here. We’re making government data more accessible and useful. It’s a big challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started really putting the building blocks for Shovels in place, digging and framing the foundation (to use an apropos building analogy), we understood that there would three core objects in the data structure: addresses, permits, and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made sense that they would be related. Permits have addresses. Contractors have permits. Therefore, contractors would also have addresses. We knew we could tie them all together in a relational database and help software developers build some really compelling applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they did, and they are. We’re really excited to be helping a new crop of property, real estate, climate, and construction entrepreneurs build cool new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we kept hearing from our own sales and marketing outreach that there was a product missing. They wanted to be able to browse the permits and contractors in our system. They wanted to be able to download this data without needing to contact us, wait for a reply, and then negotiate a price on a custom report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer became clear. We needed to build our own software product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The need for a building data application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not the first to aggregate and sell building permit data. If you look for it, you can find a half dozen other companies that have been doing this long before we started thinking about doing it in October 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, those incumbents are mostly stodgy old data services. They barely have an API and prefer to sell annual licenses to heavy datasets that only data engineers can parse and access. It’s not a startup-friendly approach, and when we looked these guys up, we weren’t impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that the first step for Shovels would be to launch an API. We did that for permits in August 2023, and we followed up a couple of months later with our contractor API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like I said, it wasn’t enough. An API is not user-friendly. Most people in the building trades don’t know what it is. A lot of you reading this may not be familiar with the concept either. We were limited in who we could sell to, and the market continued to be underserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late 2023, we had the bandwidth to build our own software application using our own public API. We started building using a relatively new technology called Flutter. I’ll explain why this is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter is an open-source software development kit released by Google in 2015. Originally intended to be cross-platform, allowing developers to release both Android and iOS applications from a single codebase, it expanded in 2019 to also support web applications. Flutter 3 was released in March 2022. This is what we’re on today, and it will allow us to also release MacOS and Linux applications, in addition to web, Android, and iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Flutter and technologies like it are awesome and I’m glad to be among the first companies to fully embrace it. We know that many people in the building trades live on their smartphones. They’re always on the move, so a mobile application makes sense. Flutter allows us to support our web application and mobile applications from a single codebase so we can develop and release faster than anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re launching our web application today, but you can expect us to follow up with Android and iOS apps very soon! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features of the Shovels app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching with the ability to find and profile each of our three core objects: addresses, permits, and contractors. Let’s go through each one! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Address Permit Profiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight forward. Look up an address, get the permits! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Address profile page" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/5757-permits.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see all the permits on 5757 Central Ave, Boulder CO, an office building outside of downtown Boulder. Yes, we cover commercial properties, too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick note: The address lookup process still needs some TLC. You may find that we don’t return addresses on properties you know have permits. That’s likely a geocoding issue, and we’re working on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing profiles on properties and these will become even more useful and robust in the coming months. Soon, you’ll find the standard property details (lot size, stories, square feet, etc) as well as contact info for the occupants. Use this for marketing, analytics, and your own product enhancements! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Permit Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to dig up this 5757 Central Ave property is by finding all commercial permits in the Boulder area. I searched for a downtown Boulder ZIP code and set our tag filter to “commercial” to see it in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Commercial permits in Boulder" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/boulder-commercial.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click on any of these addresses to see the same level of detail shown in the previous snapshot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Permits zoomed in" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/boulder-commercial-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other notes on our Permit Database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search by keyword&lt;/strong&gt;: You can put any text you want in here and we’ll scan the descriptions of over 120M permits to find the ones that match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search by state or zip&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now you can only limit the geography by ZIP code and state. Soon, you’ll also be able to search by city, county, or the permit jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter on permit fees and job value&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to further refine your search, you can set minimum thresholds of permit fees and job values. The permit fees are collected by the county and the job values are self-reported, usually by the contractor. Note that not every jurisdiction collects these values, but if they do, we’ll have them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download to a CSV file&lt;/strong&gt;: Each of our tables includes a download feature so you can take this data into your other software products and make magic happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contractor Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our third feature is also suitable for personal use. Have you ever needed to find a contractor and wished you could just see who all of your neighbors used for that remodel, or cottage, or solar installation? The benefits of hiring someone who’s been in your neighborhood before are several:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most houses in a neighborhood were built around the same time, often by the same developer. Therefore, they have similar attics, crawl spaces, and wiring. It helps when a contractor knows what your house feels like before he shows up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permitting can be challenging, so it’s best to hire a contractor who knows what to expect of your local building department. If they know him, they may treat his permit requests differently. These little things matter!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractors who know your neighborhood are invested. They want to do a good job, because they want you to recommend them. It’s best to hire someone who wants to expand their business in your neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; tell you who works in your neighborhood? Yelp. Or Google. Or Nextdoor (unless you put up a post and ask.) The only reliable, consistent, accurate way to find which contractors work in your neighborhood is to use building permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Find building contractors by permit type" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/find-by-job.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I’m looking for every commercial contractor in the same Boulder ZIP code. How do we know a contractor is “commercial”? We know by their permits. This feature searches for commercial permits and then returns all of the contractors on those permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes sense, right? Seems like something like this should have been out there long ago, right? We agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s coming out next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that everything we’re doing here is available on &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;our public API&lt;/a&gt;. We are building this app using the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; endpoints that our customers can access. This software app is kind of like an API demo, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re already working on V2 of our API. The V2 will have a bunch of cool new stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching for permits using lat / long coordinates. That way you can drag the map and we’ll automatically update the permit results!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching by cities, counties, and jurisdictions. We know it’s frustrating to search by ZIP code. There are reasons why we did it that way to start, and the V2 will fix that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing a jurisdiction dashboard. Wouldn’t it be great to see a dashboard of every permit under review, recently approved, or finalized in any jurisdiction in the country? We’re on it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get property details with the permit history. We’re going to include tax assessor data in future address profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just a sneak preview! Before we can update our app, we have to update the API. It’s already under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does this cost anything, by the way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! We are going to charge $499/mo per account for access to all of this amazing data. You’ll get a generous trial period, though, and all of our constant updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we release the V2, price will probably go up, but we’ll won’t raise prices on our early customers. &lt;/p&gt;

The books they discuss include 'The Hard Thing About Hard Things' by Ben Horowitz, 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear, 'Zero to One' by Peter Thiel, and 'Predictable Revenue' by Aaron Ross. They highlight the importance of embracing challenges, focusing on process over outcomes, and creating original work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the difficulties and challenges in business, as they can lead to personal and professional growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on building effective habits and processes, as they can have a big cumulative impact over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the difference between zero-to-one and one-to-end businesses, and the value of creating something original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialize and optimize different parts of your sales process to improve conversion rates and drive predictable revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We can also now share tables to Snowflake, Big Query, and Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month we launched &lt;a href="https:/app.shovels.ai"&gt;our web app&lt;/a&gt;. This month we're offering even more ways to get your hands on our building permit and contractor data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we want to meet you IRL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days ago we launched an &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt;. You can find it now on Google Play. Next month we'll launch on the Apple App Store, too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's meet! The Shovels team will be in SF from March 18-19 and LA on March 21. We'll come to your office. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more data and API enhancements. Details below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can now push permit and contractor tables into Big Query, Snowflake, Databricks, S3, GCS, and Azure! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;We're so mobile&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built the Shovels app using a relatively new technology called Flutter. This software development kit gives our small team a ton of leverage to build cross-platform and make rapid improvements to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's because of Flutter that we can build a web app and a mobile app at the same time, with the same code, and without a ton of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say it gives us mobility. We're moving fast! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a few screenshots of our Android app. Get it on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;Google Play now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We could have launched iOS too, but I gotta save &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; for April.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mobile app screenshots" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/screenshots.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hang out with us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels team is international. I'm in California. Luka and Petra are in Europe. We only meet in person a couple of times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for you, the next convening is happening the week of March 18 and we want to meet. We'd love to come to your office and chat face-to-face about how you think about building permit and contractor data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about a small team is we can fit in a single Uber. We'll come to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Francisco: March 18-19   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA area: March 21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just reply to me and we'll figure out a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shovels in your data lake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that for many of you, API access doesn't fully scratch the itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have bigger plans that will be realized only if you can merge our permits with your own data. We can send you our db files, but to pull them into Snowflake (or wherever) you'll need help from your engineering team and oh boy, that'll take forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now offering private shares of our production database tables into Big Query, Snowflake, Databricks, S3, GCS, and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's super fast and easy and gives you unlimited access to query and join our permit and contractor tables with your data lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've already done the engineering -- so you don't have to! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Shovels March release&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a new month, and with that, a bunch of new fixes. Here's our March release notes. We pushed all this to production about a week ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better address validation&lt;/strong&gt;: We've improved our ability to validate and enhance cities and ZIP codes on permit addresses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements in contractor grouping&lt;/strong&gt;: We're using more comprehensive details, including addresses and phone numbers, to cluster contractor branches into groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new address dataset&lt;/strong&gt;: We added over three million exact geo locations to our permits table. We are closing down the gap of unlinked permits (permits without geo coordinates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements in our internal docs&lt;/strong&gt;: We move fast but we also recognize that investing in good documentation now will save us headaches later. We created a new internal knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;: We introduced a &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_id_v1_permits_get"&gt;new API call&lt;/a&gt; that allows for the specification of multiple permits in a single request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: In response to API usage patterns, we've restructured our database architecture. No more timeouts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: We have integrated with an awesome tool to help us track API usage, errors, and patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: make permit predictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that when one of your neighbors gets an ADU, or installs solar panels, or does the huge remodel and room addition, it seems to trigger everyone else in the neighborhood to do the same? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's FOMO in the home improvement market. I think we can measure this "Keeping up with the Jones's" phenomenon with building permit data and start to see where this wave of home improvements might be swelling in a particular neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not enough of a data scientist to give this justice (and apparently ChatGPT isn't either -- it wasn't very helpful this time) but with our table sharing (see above), perhaps &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can crack this riddle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a chart showing the distribution of the percentage of homes with permits since 2023 by ZIP code. What I mean by that is how much variance is there in "permits per capita" nationwide? Most ZIPs have low permit density, but a few are very active ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's causing the difference? We don't know yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Distribution of permit density by ZIP code" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-distribution.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is long enough&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I plan to announce our iOS app and give a teaser for our V2 API and describe how it will improve the Shovels web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry><entry><title>The list of every building permit jurisdiction in the US</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-04-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-04-06:/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels is open-sourcing of a comprehensive list of building permit jurisdictions that we discovered only recently. Our new database includes over ten thousand building permit jurisdictions and associates each jurisdiction with a county and state.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rbucks/building-permit-jurisdictions-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;another Kaggle dataset&lt;/a&gt; from the Shovels vault. Our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/images/jurisdiction_mappings.csv"&gt;latest file&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive mapping of state, county, and building permit jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this list of building permit jurisdictions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file includes over 10,000 building permit jurisdictions (AHJs -- authority-having jurisdictions), and relates each jurisdiction to its respective state and county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this mapping buried in an &lt;a href="https://socds.huduser.gov/permits/" target="_blank"&gt;obscure government website&lt;/a&gt;. We noticed that when we clicked on a state, a select box appeared with all of the counties in that state. This mapping is widely available from the US Census and many other open data sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we clicked on the county, another select box appeared with every building permit jurisdiction in the county. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; got our attention. Before this discovery, we didn't know of a single source of truth for how many AHJs are out there for building permits. Now we can count at least 10,000 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who needs a list of every building permit jurisdiction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When architects, developers, and homeowners start a new project, the first question they might ask is, "Where do I file my building permits?" The answer is far from obvious! Many cities don't have building departments; they delegate building permitting to the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list we are open-sourcing today includes every building permit jurisdiction. If a city or town is on this list, then they issue their own building permits. If a city or town is not on this list, then it's safe to conclude that their AHJ is the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We figure many folks who work in cities and counties don't know every AHJ within their boundaries. Now they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How many building permit jurisdictions are in each state?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got curious and decided to ask this data a few questions. How many AHJs are in each state? Does that jurisdiction count correlate with population? We had to merge in some public census data to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, there are about ten permit jurisdictions per county. If a county has a million residents, that means each permit jurisdiction serves about 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania stands out with the highest number of permit jurisdictions, totaling 1575. No other state comes close! It's unclear why Pennsylvania needs so many of them. For example, although Pennsylvania has the same population as Ohio, it has almost 3X the number of building permit jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart makes the outliers easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Population vs Jurisdiction Count" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/jurisdictions-vs-population.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's a table of every state, its population, number of jurisdictions, and the ratio of jurisdictions per 100,000 residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam is an easy-to-use financial platform whose mission is to empower builders with better financial tools and services. Beam helps contractors take control of their project finances,  improve cash flow, and ultimately earn more money.  One of the ways they grow their business is through cold outreach to contractors. This is an effective customer acquisition strategy provided there is a source of quality leads, and an opportunity to reach out at the right time with a personalized message. When expensive lead lists yielded poor results, Beam turned to Shovels. Shovels' ability to provide high-quality, regularly updated leads enriched with information such as permit type and recent activity proved to be a game changer for Beam’s outreach efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beam’s Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of homes and infrastructure are built and maintained by small and midsized contractors. However, most financial software has underserved these businesses, and many great builders still rely on paper checks, spreadsheets, and accounting software from the 90s. As a result, the payment process is error-prone and inefficient, leading to long delays and cash flow challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam’s easy-to-use financial platform is built to serve the needs of small and mid sized contractors to help them move their processes online, speed up payments, and better manage their cash flow. In order to acquire new customers, Beam relied on cold outreach as one of their strategies.This proved to be challenging - lead lists were expensive, often contained information about companies and contractors no longer in business, and had no information on specific projects the business was engaged in or its recency. These lists had better data about the types of companies found on LinkedIn and not the small and medium sized businesses who were Beam’s target customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam therefore resorted to looking up contractor information on the Contractors State License Board (CSLB) public database, and this yielded a massive list. Calling businesses one at a time was inefficient. Many licensees contacted were either not in business anymore or were not actively working on a project. As a result, the yield rate from cold outreach was poor and the return on investment of time and effort was very low. Beam sought a better solution to high quality lead generation, and found that Shovels had the perfect solution to their challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Beam chose Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels analyzes over 100M building permits to help customers with lead generation by offering a comprehensive and filterable database tailored to the construction sector, adding between 5 and 10 million new permits nationwide every month. Raw permit data is cleansed, parsed, granularly categorized, and enriched with other data such as contractor profile information through cross referencing multiple data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels’ ability to deliver high quality data containing detailed information including the type of permit filed, the date of filing, the profile of the contractor who applied for the permit and the permit fees paid made the company’s offering stand out. Top notch customer service during the sales and onboarding process sealed the deal for Beam. 
Shovels enabled Beam to efficiently and cost effectively generate a lead list, personalize their messaging, and reach out at the right time to prospects, thus scaling their cold outreach and providing a significant edge to grow their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Beam Used Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Shovels became an integral part of Beam's cold outreach strategy,  their outreach efforts underwent a significant transformation. For instance, when the latest weekly data from Shovels listed a contractor who had pulled an ADU permit in the past month, the Beam team would swing into action and promptly reach out to the prospect using the contact information provided in the data feed. They would then establish rapport with the potential customer by citing an example of another customer who also constructs ADUs, whom they had assisted in achieving cost savings and efficiency. This type of timely, personalized outreach helped Beam earn trust and sign up new customers, eventually proving to be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of Shovels data in Beam’s cold outreach strategy resulted in a remarkable 20 to 30% higher likelihood of contractor engagement. Not only was Beam able to save time and effort by only reaching out to those contractors who had recently applied for a permit, they were also able to win new customers at a higher rate through personalizing their outreach efforts and reaching prospects at the beginning stages of a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The periodic data updates from Shovels helped fill Beam’s sales pipeline with prospects and helped the Beam team nurture awareness which subsequently transformed to consideration and high purchase intent among their target customers. The data also provided the Beam team with information about the other projects the contractor was working on, as well as information about derivative metrics such as inspection pass rates enabling future business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

We know you are too. This is the start of the killer building permit application. The one that should have existed all along. We also can push 100 million building permits and contractors straight into Snowflake, Big Query, and Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels April 2024 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month was a planning month for us. Luka and Petra joined me in California and we spent a lot of time together. We met a few of you in person, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this mingling and meeting helped us set the stage for the next phase of Shovels. We're growing up a bit. I'll explain what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shovels V2 is in the works! I'll share more about what exactly this means. In short: a whole bunch of stuff you've told us you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the V2 is our focus, I've neglected our iOS app development. It's just so V1. We'll get it launched in prep for V2, but it'll take us another month. In the meantime, we've been updating &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;the Android app&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSA: We can now share 130M permits and 2.5M contractors directly into your Snowflake, Big Query, or Databricks account. This makes some data scientists VERY happy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ever wanted a list of every building permit jurisdiction? &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/"&gt;We released one&lt;/a&gt;. We're working on a V2 of that, too. It will have at least 5,000 more jurisdictions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out how &lt;a href="https://www.trybeam.com/"&gt;Beam&lt;/a&gt;, one of our happy customers, is using Shovels to &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-revolutionizing-lead-generation-for-beam/"&gt;reach out to contractors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join us at our &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/z40116as"&gt;Zero Carbon Building Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt; in Lafayette, CA on Earth Day, Monday April 22!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2 is better than 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There comes a time when you just need to cut bait and start over. After watching you use and build on Shovels, and building our own web and mobile apps, it became clear that our API design needed an overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just a 1.1. We needed to sorta break everything. (But don't worry, V1 will be out for a while, and we'll help you through the transition!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's so awesome about our V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filters galore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're combining tax assessor data with permit data! The possibilities are endless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter building permits by lot and building area size, and number of units and stories. Want every solar permit on a $2 million house? Every ADU permit on a 20,000 sq ft lot? You'll have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll also be able to filter permits by city, county, and jurisdiction. I know, long time coming on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, there will be parity between permit and contractor filters. Want every solar &lt;em&gt;contractor&lt;/em&gt; who worked on a $2 million house? Every ADU &lt;em&gt;contractor&lt;/em&gt; who worked on a 20,000 sq ft lot? You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't possible in V1 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All new tagging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Shovels user filters by permit tags. Now we're going to make them wayyyy better. Thanks to some AWS incubator credits, we can use AI to tag all 130M permits for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're adding new tags and making them two-level. Check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rq0VbzD1FKcBzWAhGaAwbqlqm-BZa6nhM8F_qyNcMQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;working draft here&lt;/a&gt; and reply with your feedback. Let us know what's missing! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early tagging results are as amazing as you'd expect. What a time to be a data company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More contact info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have A LOT more contact info on homeowners and contractors than we currently expose through the V1 API. This is going to change in V2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In V2, you'll get the homeowners of a given address, all the people who work at a contractor company, and all the contact info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one customer recently told me, the industry needs a ZoomInfo for the building trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know which contractors are actually active, Shovels is in the perfect position to deliver it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things we hear from customers is that Shovels is useful for investment and market selection decisions. However, we don't make it easy for them to count and roll up all of the permits by geo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's fixed in V2. I mentioned that cities, counties, and jurisdictions will be filters. Well, they'll also have profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see every building permit in flight in Palo Alto? How long it's taking to get approval? We'll calculate permit approval times by tag or tag group. We'll also help you navigate between counties, cities, ZIP codes, and the elusive jurisdiction. Each one will have a profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addresses will have profiles too! See all the permits, contractors, and roll up metrics on any address in our database. This is also coming in V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a data company, but the software play is just so obvious. Somebody needed to build it. Why not us? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a little preview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Explore our permit data using our web app" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/explore.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're a smart, passionate team that loves to use data and technology to be more efficient, especially in their marketing. We're pleased to provide them with contractor and permit data that increases the conversion on their outreach and drives more revenue to their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Shovels AI Custom GPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the construction and renovation industry, finding accurate and timely information on building permits and contractors is essential. The &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;Shovels custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline this process. It interacts with the &lt;a href="https://shovels.redoc.ly"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt;, providing users with easy access to detailed data on over 113 million building permits and 3 million contractors across 48 states in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post will guide you on how to effectively use this tool, with some cool examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Features of Shovels AI Custom GPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: Access data related to building permits and contractors in nearly every U.S. state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag-based Searches&lt;/strong&gt;: Perform searches based on specific types of work such as roofing, windows, pools, or EV chargers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and Zip Code Filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Limit your search to specific states or zip codes to find localized information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date Filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Search permits based on the start and end dates of permit filings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started with Your Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of Shovels AI, start by determining the type of information you need. Here are some steps to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Your Query Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Decide whether you need information on building permits or contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify Location&lt;/strong&gt;: You can filter your search by state or zip code. For example, if you're interested in construction activities in Texas, mention it in your prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select a Tag (if applicable)&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're looking for specific types of permits, like those for electrical work, you will need to tell the GPT what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Query 1: Searching for Roofing Permits in a Zip Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to find all recent roofing permits in the 90210 zip code. Here’s how you can use the tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;roofing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;permits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90210&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPT will then provide a list of roofing permits in this area, detailing the permits’ descriptions, filing dates, and associated contractors if available. Sometimes it won't give the contractors, though. If that happens, ask for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;List the contractors too
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Query 2: Finding Contractors Specialized in Pool Installations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a contractor for a new pool installation in Orlando, Florida, you need to look up some ZIP codes in Orlando. As of this writing, Shovels does not currently support city-based searches. Once you have the zip code, you can proceed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;contractors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;permits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32805&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in a list of contractors who have recently installed pools in 32805.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Effective Searches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Complete Addresses&lt;/strong&gt;: When searching by address, make sure to provide the full address including street number, name, and zip code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Tags&lt;/strong&gt;: Be specific about what types of permits you want. The GPT does a pretty good job of choosing the right Shovels permit tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Dates&lt;/strong&gt;: Remember to include a date range if you want one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Shovels Empowers Carbon Free Homes: Achieving 100% Installation Targets with Our Contractor Matching Platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Free Homes faced significant difficulties in connecting homeowners with qualified contractors for the installation of heat pumps, water heaters, and other climate-friendly appliances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a growing awareness and demand among homeowners for such technologies, the availability of trustworthy contractors who are capable, willing, and ready to take on these projects was limited. The traditional methods of finding these contractors were inefficient and often led to unreliable data that hindered scalability and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, Carbon Free Homes turned to Shovels, a comprehensive and filterable database drawn from over 100 million building permit applications nationwide, updated monthly. Shovels provides detailed, high-quality data that includes the type of permit filed, the date of filing, and the profile and contact information of the contractor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution enabled Carbon Free Homes to efficiently connect homeowners with reputable contractors, significantly reducing the time and effort required to sift through data manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration with Shovels led to remarkable outcomes for Carbon Free Homes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieved 100% of the target numbers for pilot installations of heat pumps, water heaters, and induction stoves in San Anselmo and Fairfax, Marin County, CA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamlined the process of contractor matching, which was previously a major bottleneck, enhancing customer satisfaction and trust in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitated a group buy program that provided homeowners within a service area access to more competitive bids and seamless installation processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This efficient system not only improved the rate of successful installations but also supported the expansion of Carbon Free Homes' service offerings, including the launch of their Collaboration Energy group buying platform.&lt;/p&gt;
