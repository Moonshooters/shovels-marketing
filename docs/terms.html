    claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis
    under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all
    arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement
    applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
    employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
    authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided
    under these Terms.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" style="margin-left:0in"><b>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>           
    </span></b><b>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</b>.  Before
    either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party
    a written Notice of Dispute (“<b>Notice</b>”) describing the nature and basis
    of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company
    should be sent to: 3515 Mt. Diablo Blvd Unit #51, Lafayette, California 94549. 
    After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the
    claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim
    or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party
    may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made
    by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
    has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
    entitled.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" style="margin-left:0in"><b>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>            
    </span></b><b>Arbitration Rules</b>.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
    interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  The arbitration
    will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution
    provider.  Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for
    relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be
    subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
    procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/;
    all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
    Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
    http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also
    available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is
    not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
    forum.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and
    disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of
    the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
<p class="Legal2Cont3" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">You
    may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
    submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually
    agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
    entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>

    authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
    Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
    applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement
    including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this
    Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the
    rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company.  The arbitration proceeding
    will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
    or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
    dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
    authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
    relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s
    rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator
    shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
    findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
    of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award
    relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. 
    The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>

    or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
    Agreement, except as specified in Section 8.2(a) (Applicability of Arbitration
    Agreement) above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
    damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. 
    However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
    arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

    COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
    ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
    OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law
    precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute,
    claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the
    arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State
    of California.  All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be
