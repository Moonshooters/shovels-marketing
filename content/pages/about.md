        Why Now?
      </h1>
      <p class="leading-normal text-2xl mb-8">
      We hear over and over again how the entire construction industry is slow to adopt new
      technology. The field is littered with startups who failed to get contractors to adopt a
      new app.

      Fortunately, we're not trying to be in the field. Instead, we're in the offices of the
      people who decide who to hire and fund and we gather data from the municipalities that
      issue and inspect building permits. This part of the construction industry is moving
      online and we're able to take advantage of it.
